<p class="blockquot2">This play makes use of the old German belief
that the Christ-Child returns to earth each
Christmas Eve to seek shelter among men. A
little waif, lost in the snow, is refused help by
the selfishness of happiness, of ill-temper, of
poverty, of riches, and is at last received by
two little children who take him for the Holy
Child indeed.</p>

to make her invisible, and learns that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">-viii-</a></span>
the little brothers and sisters do not love an
impatient and unkind older one. Much
grieved, she tries through the year to correct
her faults, but is almost afraid to repeat the
experiment when the Elves again bring their
gift. The friendly Elves urge her, and the
result is so happy that Toinette and the Elves
have a gay little celebration all by themselves.</p>

<h2><a name="SUGGESTIONS_FOR_PRODUCTION" id="SUGGESTIONS_FOR_PRODUCTION">SUGGESTIONS FOR PRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p>These little plays were written for the classes and clubs of a small
Sunday-school, where the Christmas celebration consisted of a play to
introduce Santa Claus and a Christmas-tree. They are equally suitable
for children at home or in day schools, and they have been so used.</p>

<p>In most of the plays children greatly enjoy playing the adult parts
and do good work in them. But several of the adult rôles call for
adult players, because a deeper appreciation of the feeling contained
in the story is required than can be given by girls in their teens.
Such parts are the Babushka, the Mother in "<a href="#THE_CHRIST-CANDLE">The Christ-Candle</a>," and
the Mother in "<a href="#TOINETTE_AND_THE_ELVES">Toinette</a>." Partly for the same reason, a man should be
chosen for the Abbot in "<a href="#THE_CHRISTMAS_MONKS">The Christmas Monks</a>," but also his presence
will lend dignity, and much greater orderliness to rehearsals in a
play with a large cast.</p>

<p>The last two plays, adapted from stories by well-known writers,
"<a href="#MINTY-MALVINYS_SANTA_CLAUS">Minty-Malviny's Santa Claus</a>" and "<a href="#THE_HUNDRED">The Hundred</a>," were not especially
intended for children, but as parlor plays for home production. These
two throw heavier work upon a single child than any of the other
plays, but though they were made with special children in view, it
would not be difficult to find, in any group of children, a little
girl who could play "Minty" or "Tibbie" as well as those for whom the
parts were first made.</p>

<p>The length of the cast in some of the plays need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">-xvi-</a></span> not be daunting, as
the principal characters are usually few, the minor ones often having
been introduced in answer to the frequent pleading "May <i>I</i> be in the
'show' this year?" Though some of the parts are rather long, none are
in the least calculated to strain the actors in any way&mdash;children
act them with zest and absolute naturalness. Very little children
have sometimes done remarkable work in them&mdash;the very youngest, a
tiny girl of four, cast for "Rosalia" in "<a href="#THE_CHRISTMAS_MONKS">The Christmas Monks</a>,"
played also another part at twenty-four hours' notice, when a little
cousin inopportunely came down with measles on Christmas Eve. The two
children had studied together, and little "Rosalia" knew "Peggy's"
part as well as her own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lighting.</span> No one factor is more important for success in
producing children's plays than adequate lighting. No matter how
charmingly the setting and costuming may be carried out, no matter
how well the children may act their parts, if the audience cannot
<i>see</i> them easily, the pains and trouble of the stage force, the best
efforts of the children, will be lost. This is an individual problem,
each case varying so much from the next that definite directions to
fit all cases cannot well be given. But the importance of this one
factor can hardly be overestimated. Fortunate indeed is the miniature
stage with footlights and upper lights so arranged that red and white
bulbs are controlled by different switches, each switch having also a
dimmer. Nor are these things so expensive as to be beyond even rather
moderate means, especially if included in the original equipment of
the stage. It is more often from lack of experience than because of
their initial cost that they are omitted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stage Settings.</span> Through the same lack of experi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">-xvii-</a></span>ence or
forethought, settings are often provided which are of use in the
minimum instead of the maximum number of plays. The simplest cottage
interior is more adaptable, and can be used in a greater number of
instances than the most attractive of more pronounced "sets." It is
therefore invaluable for a small stage, where perhaps but one indoor
and one outdoor scene must cover all requirements. All but two of the
plays in this volume have been acted upon such a little stage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Delays.</span> Another point of real importance is to avoid delays.
The director should make every effort to this end by attention to
the smallest details beforehand, by preparedness when the time of
performance comes, and by perfect control of the stage forces.
Lateness in beginning, and long waits between scenes, are tedious to
any audience. They do much to dampen enthusiasm and destroy otherwise
happy impressions. Care and forethought, practice for those who
are to handle scenery, and system in the arrangement of properties
and costumes will go a long way towards the elimination of this
difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Costumes and Properties.</span> In giving stage directions and
descriptions of costumes, the effort has been towards suggestiveness
rather than too great definiteness, and strict adherence to all
details is not necessary or intended. It is most important to
keep the Christmas spirit of the play from being smothered in the
mechanics of production. Setting and costuming may be elaborate
or simple, and every director will know his or her own resources.
Groups of people interested in such work are apt to accumulate sets
of costumes, odd properties, even pieces of furniture, which are
convertible to many other uses than those for which they were made.
Few things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">-xviii-</a></span> are really impossible to compass if one is set upon them.
A friendly janitor will spend his leisure upon stage-carpentry.
Friends rise up&mdash;or may be sought&mdash;who are interested enough to lend
their treasures, or to use their talents. One will draw a latticed
window which may be pinned or basted upon a bit of plain wall;
another will manufacture a scutcheon for the decoration of a medieval
hall, or even paint a sea scene before which Alice, the Gryphon, and
the Mock-Turtle may disport themselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Materials.</span> Gifts of old silk gowns, or even scraps of
material, can all be utilized in some way. And in this connection, a
word must be said as to the value of <i>real</i> things. Use cheese-cloth,
cambric, and canton-flannel if you must&mdash;a good variety of color may
be found in them; canton-flannel is heavy, and hangs well, and up to
a certain point they are all effective. But if better things can be
had, through gift or loan, it is a matter for rejoicing. Not only
because better materials mean softer and richer colors, but because
they very greatly improve the <i>texture</i> of the stage picture. This
difference in quality makes a very marked difference in beauty of
effect.</p>

<p>Occasionally it will be found necessary to hire costumes, and, more
often, wigs. But all such things as can be made, with help, by the
children and their friends, will add just so much to their interest
in the performance, and the good they can get from it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Make-up.</span> For plays produced under artificial light, some
"make-up" must be used, as otherwise faces are often pale to
ghastliness. But for children it should be put on with a very careful
and sparing hand, and except in certain character-parts, only a
little dry rouge is needed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">-xix-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rehearsing.</span> Children's plays should not be over-rehearsed.
The smoothness and finish which it is right to demand of older
players is hardly possible, or even desirable, for them. The charm
of their acting lies in its sweet simplicity and freshness, a part
of which is almost sure to be lost in any attempt at professional
perfection. When they weary of rehearsals, and lose their enjoyment
of them, not only are the director's troubles multiplied, but
something vital has been lost from the charm of the final performance.</p>

<p>As a preliminary to rehearsals the children should be brought
together and the cast read to them, so that each child may know
just which part he or she is to act, and the play then read to them
by someone thoroughly in sympathy both with its story and with the
children themselves. In this way they most quickly catch the spirit
of the play, and are at once full of interest and ready with their
own suggestions. Then the parts may be given out, and the play
read again, each child reading his or her own part. Mistakes of
pronunciation and emphasis are thus guarded against, and the children
are ready to begin learning their parts. In the case of school plays,
where the whole group can meet daily, more than one such preliminary
reading and discussion should be held.</p>

<p>If it is a possible thing, rehearse from the beginning on the stage
where the play is to be given, having scenery arranged and properties
of some sort on hand, in order that lines and action may be impressed
on the children's minds together, not learned as distinct and
separate things. Put into practice early whatever music is to be used.</p>

<p>Finally, don't let the rehearsals at any time descend to the level
of mere <i>drill</i>. The director must enjoy them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">-xx-</a></span> with the children,
establishing a happy co-operation which makes the whole work a joy
from beginning to end. They will share the spirit of adventure in the
matter of obtaining or contriving the most difficult things in the
way of costumes, scenery, and properties. Their inventiveness will
be quickened, their hands will grow skillful, and their triumphant
enjoyment of success in these preliminary labors will stimulate them
to greater success in the acting of the story. In this, they will be
quick to appreciate hints&mdash;frequently to offer them&mdash;as to the best
ways of expressing the meaning and spirit of the play, and work with
them becomes an inspiration to all alike.</p>

<p>With such whole-hearted co-operation, nothing is impossible of
attainment, and the pleasure of the work more than repays ungrudging
lavishment of time, labor, patience, and love.</p>

<h3>SCENE I</h3>

<p class="bp"><i>Christmas Eve, in the forest near</i> <span class="smcap">Mother Madelon's</span>
<i>cottage. The ground is covered with snow and the little evergreens
all about are weighted down with it. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Fritz</span> (<i>L.</i>)
<i>with his brothers and sisters, laden with holly boughs and
evergreens. The boys drag a sled with a small evergreen tree on it.
As they come they sing "Softly the Echoes Come and Go."</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Fritz.</span> Stop here and rest, Heinrich. This is too big a load
for the little ones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barbara.</span> Yes, Karl is all out of breath, and little Jan can
hardly keep up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heinrich</span> [<i>dropping the sled rope</i>]. I'm not tired. I'm
going to run back to the holly trees to get a few more sprays.
[<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar</span> [<i>who has been measuring the tree with his arm.</i>]
Fritz, do you think the good St. Nicholas can cover such a big tree
as this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Karl.</span> It's pretty big. It's bigger than me&mdash;or Katrina&mdash;I
guess it's bigger than Fritz or Barbara or Heinrich.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Katrina.</span> I think it's bigger than the one St. Nicholas
filled for us last year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">-4-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jan.</span> But then, you see, we are bigger children than we were
last year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fritz.</span> But the tree is almost big enough to hold you on the
top branches, kleiner Bruder, if the good St. Nicholas wanted to put
you there. See! [<i>He and</i> <span class="smcap">Barbara</span> <i>help</i> <span class="smcap">Jan</span> <i>on
top of the load. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Heinrich</span> <i>excitedly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heinrich.</span> Fritz, Fritz! And, Barbara, and all of you! Listen
to what I've seen. I was running over to the holly trees, you know,
when I tripped on a bit of grape-vine, and rolled over in the snow.
[<i>Brushes snow from his clothes.</i>] And when I sat up there was the
queerest little black cottage right there. I do believe it just came
up out of the ground like a house in a fairy-book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fritz.</span> Oh no, it didn't, Heinrich, it's always been there!
I've seen it many a time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heinrich.</span> I don't believe it! Why didn't I ever see it then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barbara.</span> Oh, never mind that! Tell us some more about the
house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heinrich.</span> I crept up, and looked in at the window, for, of
course, I thought there might be brownies, or gnomes, or kobolds
there, and I saw&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Children</span> [<i>breathlessly</i>]. What? Oh, what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heinrich</span>. A poor woman and two little children&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Children</span> [<i>disappointed</i>]. O-o-h!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fritz.</span> That all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heinrich.</span> Just wait! They looked so poor and hungry&mdash;there
wasn't a thing on the table but a dry little loaf of bread&mdash;and only
a few little sticks on the fire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Katrina.</span> Oh, it makes me so sorry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">-5-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heinrich</span> [<i>shaking his head wisely</i>]. That's not the worst
of it. When I got to the window the two children were standing by the
mother's chair, looking up in her face and asking her something. I
couldn't hear what they said, but she shook her head oh, so sadly,
and said: "No, my little ones, the good St. Nicholas will not find
his way to us this Christmas." That's what she said! [<i>Silent
consternation.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fritz.</span> What? What did you say, Heinrich?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barbara.</span> It couldn't be so!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Karl.</span> St. Nicholas!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar.</span> Not find his way everywhere!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Katrina.</span> Not give them any beautiful Tannenbaum!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fritz.</span> Oh, I don't believe it! You didn't hear right!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heinrich.</span> I did. And I do believe it! You would if you had
seen how sorry they looked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fritz.</span> Well, but&mdash;well, I don't see&mdash;well, Heinrich, it
isn't so hard to find. He <i>must</i> come surely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heinrich.</span> No, he isn't coming. The poor woman said so and
she must know. [<i>Sitting down on sled.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barbara.</span> Yes, she must know. Father and Mother always see
the good saint first, you know, and tell him whether we've been
naughty or good. They always know whether he is coming or not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Katrina.</span> But he always <i>does</i> come to us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oscar.</span> Brother Fritz, Mother says the good St. Nicholas
loves to give presents to little children. Wouldn't he be sorry if
there was a house anywhere in the <i>world</i> that he didn't know about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Karl.</span> Brother Fritz, couldn't <i>we</i> show him the way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fritz</span> [<i>claps him on the shoulder</i>]. Well spoken, Karl, my
man. We'll tell St. Nicholas all about it as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">-6-</a></span> soon as he comes to us,
and then show him the way to Heinrich's little black hut.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barbara.</span> And if he shouldn't have enough to go around, he
always brings us so much that we can spare some of our things for
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fritz.</span> Yes, he puts enough for two trees on our tree. Come,
Oscar and Karl, get hold of the rope! Barbara, you take Katrina's
hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barbara.</span> Trot along in front, Jan! Come, then, let's get
home as fast as we can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heinrich.</span> All together now! Get up, horses, pull the load
home! [<i>Exeunt (R.), singing as before. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Friedel</span>
<i>(L.), before the sound of their voices has died away, slowly
and wearily. Limps to side and peers through the trees after the
children, then to the back, then to the left again, like one who
has lost his way. Stops in the center looking doubtfully after the
children once more. Enter the woodcutter (L.), axe over his shoulder,
whistling as he hurries home.</i> <span class="smcap">Friedel</span> <i>silently holds out
his cap, but the man shrugs his shoulders, shakes his head, and
passes on.</i> <span class="smcap">Friedel</span> <i>goes slowly to a tree and sits on a log
or mound beside it. Blows on his fingers, tries to pull his rags more
closely around him, and leans his head dejectedly on his hands. Lifts
his head suddenly to watch</i> <span class="smcap">Marta</span>, <i>who approaches (L.),
hobbling under a bunch of fagots.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marta.</span> Ach, my old bones! Ach, this heavy bundle! Will ever
old Marta get home?</p>

<p class="right">
[<span class="smcap">Friedel</span> <i>silently holds out his cap.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marta</span>. What's this! What's this! What's this! Was ever heard
tell of such insolence? As if Old Marta wasn't poor enough herself,
without giving to every beggar who chooses to ask! The little
good-for-nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">-7-</a></span> sees how I stagger under my own load and yet asks
me to help him! [<i>Moves on.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friedel</span> [<i>softly</i>]. I would help you carry them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marta</span> [<i>pausing</i>]. Help me! Help me! and lose half the
sticks I have worked so hard to gather on the way! [<i>Goes on.</i>] Help
me, he says. When I want help I'll not ask the beggars that come out
of the streets of the town just a purpose to lie in wait for a poor
old crone like me. [<i>Exit (R.) mumbling.</i>] That I'll not! That I'll
not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friedel</span> [<i>looking after her</i>]. Why does she think I would
drop the sticks? I would be <i>so</i> careful. I wonder why. I almost
think she was afraid of me. Of <i>me</i>!</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Cross Jacob</span> <i>(L.).</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friedel</span> [<i>timidly</i>]. Please&mdash;please, sir, could you tell me
the way back to the town? And oh, couldn't you let me come to your
fire a little while to warm myself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cross Jacob.</span> Go away with you! It's as much as ever my wife
will do to let me warm myself at my fire. She's got nine boys of
her own to fill up my house and drive me away. Get away with you!
[<i>Shakes his fist threateningly.</i> <span class="smcap">Friedel</span> <i>recoils.</i>] Go
home to your own fire! [<i>Exit (R.).</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friedel.</span> Oh, if I only had one!</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Rich Johann</span> <i>(L.). Pauses to light
his pipe.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friedel</span> [<i>speaking timidly and hurriedly</i>]. Oh, sir! Oh,
good, <i>kind</i> sir! don't you want a little boy to help you in your
house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johann</span> [<i>looks him over</i>]. What's your name, boy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friedel.</span> Friedel, sir!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johann.</span> Umph! "Just Friedel." And who's Friedel, I'd like to
know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friedel.</span> I don't think I just know myself, sir! But, oh,
sir! [<i>clasps his hands tightly</i>], please let me work for you. I
would pick up wood for you, and build fires, and run errands. I would
work <i>so</i> hard and be <i>so</i> faithful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Johann</span> [<i>throwing back his shoulders and putting his hands
in his pockets</i>]. And who do you think I am, boy, that you presume to
want to work in my house? To work for me, Rich Johann, who has many
servants in his house, to carry out his commands and do his work and
run his errands? Umph! Do you think I could have one servant about me
clothed in such rags as yours? [<span class="smcap">Friedel</span> <i>hangs his head.</i>]
No, no! my servants wear fine clothes and brass buttons [<i>takes a
puff at his pipe</i>], yes, indeed, brass buttons. No, no! Rich Johann
lives in a very different style&mdash;a very different style, indeed.
[<i>Exit (R.), his nose very much in the air.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friedel.</span> Nobody will take me in. I have walked so far, so

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Yes, my little ones, I am afraid it is true. [<i>More

little children he must go to see every year! Someone must always be
left out. Perhaps it is our turn now. We can wait until next year.
Perhaps he will come then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hans</span> [<i>rubbing his eyes</i>]. Oh, dear, I wish to-morrow
wouldn't come at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Oh, Hans, don't say that. Think how happy we can be.

beautiful Christmas Day, when everyone in the world is happy, and we
shall hear the chimes ringing, and see people going about wishing
each other "Merry Christmas." And then we have each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">-13-</a></span> other. I have my

<span class="smcap">Hans</span> <i>brings a stool and sits at his</i> <span class="smcap">Mother's</span>
<i>feet nursing his knee.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Once upon a time, many, many years ago, it happened
that a little child was wandering all alone through the streets of a
great busy town. It was Christmas Eve, and wherever the child looked
he saw shining lights and hurrying happy people. His coat was all too
thin, and his little feet and hands were bare and frostbitten. The
sharp ice on the ground cut his feet as he walked, and the cold wind
tossed his soft hair back from his forehead. But he hardly seemed to
feel the cold, for everywhere he was watching the eager, happy faces
that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">-17-</a></span> hastened by. He looked up into a window and saw a beautiful,
wonderful tree, covered with little candles and glittering balls,
and all about the tree were gathered merry, laughing children. It
seemed as if those happy little ones would be glad to have another
little boy amongst them, and the child went quietly up the steps and
tapped at the door. But the tall man who opened it said crossly, "Go
away. I can't let you in here." So the child went sorrowfully down
the steps and wandered on again. As he went along the street many
more houses were full of light and happiness, and wherever he saw the
candle-covered Christmas trees with their cluster of gay child-faces,
he tapped softly at the door, or looked wistfully in at the window.
But everywhere the same answer was given him. "You must go on. We
can't take you in." Some people looked sorry when they said this, but
most of them hardly glanced at him at all before they shut the great
doors to keep out the cold wind. At last he came to the very last
house&mdash;a poor little cottage with just one window. But he could see
the light streaming out of it, and wearily made his way to the door.
In this little house was a Mother and two little children&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hans.</span> Just like us!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> And at one side of the room was a cradle&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretel.</span> But we haven't got any baby!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> When the little girl heard the soft tapping at the
door she said: "Shall I open it, Mother?" And the mother said, "Yes,
indeed, we mustn't let anyone stay out in the cold on the beautiful
Christmas Eve." So the child opened the door and led in the little,
shivering stranger. The mother took him on her lap and rubbed his
frozen hands, and folded her warm arms about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">-18-</a></span> him. And the children
begged him to stay with them always. Then the Mother told them the
wonderful beautiful story of the first Christmas, and how the shining
angels came to the poor shepherds in the field and sang "Glory to God
in the Highest, and on earth peace, good will towards men." And how
the shepherds went to find the dear baby in the manger, and the wise
men were led by a glorious star to find Him, too. And while she was
talking to them the room seemed filled with a strange, soft light
that grew lovelier and brighter every moment, until the children,
wondering, turned to their mother to ask what it meant. And then
they saw that the Child was gone. But the mother said: "Children, I
think we have had the real little Christ-Child with us to-night." And
after that men used to say that the Christ-Child sometimes came again
on Christmas Eve to wander from door to door asking for shelter and
love. And sometimes men drive Him away, and He can find no place to
rest. But in some homes He is given a glad and loving welcome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretel.</span> Oh, Mother, I wish, I <i>wish</i> He would come here, to
us!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hans</span> [<i>looking to the window</i>]. But, Mother, it is all
dark&mdash;there is no light in the window for Him! Mother, we've got a
little piece of a candle. Mayn't I put it in the cup that's broken
and light it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Yes, my little son.</p>

<p class="right">
[<span class="smcap">Hans</span> <i>jumps on the box and reaches a bit of<br />
candle from the mantel. Fastens it in the<br />
cup and lights it.</i> <span class="smcap">Gretel</span> <i>watching<br />
anxiously. Then together they put it in the<br />
window and sing "The Christ-Candle."</i>

1. Little taper set to-night,<br />
Throw afar thy tiny light,<br />
Up and down the darksome street,<br />
Guide the tender wand'ring feet<br />
Of the darling Christ Child sweet.<br />
<br />
2. He is coming through the snow<br />
As He came so long ago,<br />
When the stars set o'er the hill,<br />
When the town is dark and still,<br />
Comes to do the Father's will.<br />
<br />
3. Little taper, spread thy ray<br />
Make His pathway light as day,<br />
Let some door be open wide<br />
For this guest of Christmas-tide,<br />
Dearer than all else beside.<br />
<br />
4. Little Christ Child come to me,<br />
Let my heart Thy shelter be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">-21-</a></span><br />

So the bells of Christmas morn<br />
Glad shall ring, "A Christ is born."<br />

<p class="center bp"><span class="smcap">Note</span>: The air "Hearts and Flowers" can also be

<p><span class="smcap">Gretel.</span> Oh, do you think the little Christ-Child can see it
now, Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Yes, my darling. He can. And whether He comes
wandering through the snowy forests or not, He loves to know that
little children think of Him and try to please Him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hans.</span> Gretel, I'm going out to see if the light shows
outside. [<i>Goes out of the door and peers in at the window.</i>
<span class="smcap">Gretel</span> <i>keeps the door open a crack to watch him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hans</span> [<i>comes in and bends over the fire to warm his hands</i>].
It sparkles on the snow just the way the moonlight does, and it's
ever so much brighter than the stars. Do you believe it is as bright
as the star of Bethlehem?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretel.</span> Oh no! It couldn't be like that! There was never
another star that shone like <i>that</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hans.</span> Let me put another stick on the fire, Mother. If the
little Christ-Child comes He will be so cold. [<i>Puts on one or two
sticks.</i>]</p>

toast a piece of our loaf for Him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretel.</span> And I'll cut it. [<i>Both clatter to the table, where</i>
<span class="smcap">Gretel</span> <i>cuts a piece of bread, and fastening it on a stick

<p><span class="smcap">Gretel.</span> Oh, Hans, be careful, be careful, you're burning it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hans.</span> No, I'm not, but I'm toasting my face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretel.</span> Let me hold it awhile. [<i>They change places.</i>
<span class="smcap">Hans</span> <i>stands with hands on hips and feet apart watching her.

to him.</i> <span class="smcap">Friedel</span> <i>leaves the window, and goes to the door,

<p><span class="smcap">Gretel.</span> Oh, Hans! He's come! He's come! [<span class="smcap">Gretel</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretel</span> [<i>shyly taking his hand</i>]. We&mdash;we&mdash;we were waiting
for you. Come in.</p>

fire, and bending over him chafes his hands.</i> <span class="smcap">Hans</span> <i>and</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Hans.</span> Do you believe it <i>is</i> the Christ-Child, Gretel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretel</span> [<i>slowly</i>]. I&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hans</span> [<i>decidedly</i>]. I do. It <i>must</i> be. We put the candle
there for Him&mdash;and then He came. And you made toast for Him&mdash;where
<i>is</i> His toast, Gretel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretel.</span> Oh, Hans! I <i>dropped</i> it when I went to the door!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hans</span> [<i>hurries to pick it up</i>]. Never mind. It didn't hurt
it a bit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretel</span> [<i>takes it and brushes it</i>]. He won't care.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">-23-</a></span> Mother's
hearth isn't a bit dusty. [<i>Both go to</i> <span class="smcap">Friedel</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretel</span> [<i>timidly offering him the toast</i>]. Hans and I
thought you would be hungry, and so we made you some toast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friedel.</span> Oh, I am, I am. [<i>Takes a bite and turns to them.</i>]
I haven't had anything to eat since&mdash;since&mdash;Oh, I can't remember!
When was it? [<i>Puts his hand to his head.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> [<i>drawing him gently to lean against her</i>]. There,
never mind. Eat now.</p>

<p class="right">

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hans.</span> Are you <i>sure</i> it is the Christ-Child, Gretel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretel.</span> I don't know. But I think&mdash;I think if it was, His

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Where is your home, my son? And what is your name?
Why were you wandering all alone this bitter night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friedel.</span> I am Friedel. Just Friedel. Not anything else. And
I haven't any home. I wish I had. A home is what I was looking for. I
thought perhaps someone would take me in, and let me work to pay for
keeping me. But nobody wants a boy, somehow, nobody. [<i>Drops his head
in his hands.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> [<i>stroking his head</i>]. You shall never say that
again, my son. While we have still our little hut, you shall live
with us, and be an elder brother to my little ones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hans.</span> You hear that, Gretel? It isn't the Christ-Child,
after all. [<i>Rubs his fists in his eyes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretel.</span> Oh, but Hans, I believe the Christ-Child would like
this almost as much. I mean He would like our putting the candle in
the window, and making the toast and everything for this poor little
boy, almost as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">-24-</a></span> much as if it was really for Him. Because it's His
little boy, you know.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>The chimes begin.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hans.</span> Really and truly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretel.</span> Yes, I'm <i>sure</i>! Perhaps the Christ-Child sent him
to us. Oh, Hans, listen! The chimes are beginning to ring. [<i>Both run
to the window to listen. After a moment voices in the distance begin
singing "Oh, Happy Night."</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretel.</span> Oh, good saint, we were <i>so</i> afraid you wouldn't
come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hans.</span> Mother <i>said</i> you couldn't find us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Nicholas.</span> And I doubt if I could have found you, if
it hadn't been for that little gleaming candle that you put in the
window to light my way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">-27-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretel</span> [<i>holding his hand</i>]. Oh, but, St. Nicholas, we ought
to tell you that we didn't put the candle there for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Katrina.</span> Why, who was it for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretel</span> [<i>softly</i>]. It was for the Christ-Child. We thought
perhaps He would be out in the snow and cold&mdash;and we were so warm and
happy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Nicholas.</span> Let me tell you, little Gretel, though the
Christ-Child did not come, it is just as true that He sent me
to you as it is that I was led here by the clear shining of the
Christ-Candle.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON COSTUME AND SETTING</h3>

<p>The parts of the Mother and St. Nicholas should be played by adults:
other adult parts taken by young people sixteen to eighteen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother Madelon.</span> Plain dark dress, white kerchief, white
peasant's cap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hans.</span> (Eight years old.) White shirt, bright-colored vest,
full blue trousers, red stockings. Toboggan cap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretel.</span> (Six years.) Full white waist, black bodice, red
skirt, or dark skirt and red stockings. White peasant's cap. Both
children may wear wooden shoes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friedel.</span> (Boy of nine.) Very ragged coat and trousers. Bare
feet. No hat. (Should be a thin little fellow whose appearance may
give the touch of pathos.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Marta.</span> (May be taken by a boy, if preferred.) Poorly
dressed, in old shawl and hood, carrying a bundle of fagots. Face
deeply wrinkled and lined, with an ill-tempered expression.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rich Johann.</span> Velvet coat, flowered vest, full knee-breeches,
shoes with silver buckles. Broad-brimmed felt hat. Silver-headed
cane. Is very pompous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cross Jacob.</span> Rough farm clothes, heavy boots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woodcutter.</span> Fur cap, warm gloves, high boots. Carries an ax.
Is young, wholesome, rosy with work, and happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Star Child.</span> (Child of seven or eight, who can sing.) White
gown, hanging straight from neck to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">-29-</a></span> ground, with flowing sleeves.
Carries a gold wand with a star on the end, and wears a star on the
forehead. If taken by a boy, he should wear a short white sleeveless
tunic, white stockings, and sandals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fritz</span> and his sisters and brothers, children from twelve
years down to six, are dressed in ordinary outdoor winter costumes,
with as much as possible of bright color about them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Nicholas</span> differs somewhat from the accepted idea of
Santa Claus, being dignified, benign, and kindly, rather than lively
and jolly. Costume about the same,&mdash;long coat, high boots, fur cap,
flowing white beard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note for Snow Scene.</span> If not feasible to have a winter
scene for the back drop, cover the back wall with white, and fasten
drooping branches of evergreen at sides, to suggest the limbs of
trees just out of sight. The wings may be treated in the same
way,&mdash;or screens, if given in home or schoolroom. Cover the floor
with white, piling with cushions beneath in some places to give an
irregular surface, and to make the bank (R. Center), where Friedel
lies down. Four or five evergreen trees will make an effective
forest, and if quite small, they should be raised to different
heights, and banked about with white. Leave opening between them
(Back Center), in which the Star Child should appear, coming and
going very silently and slowly. Cotton snow upon the little trees and
"diamond-dust" over all, help to make this a very pretty scene.</p>

<p>For chimes, play the music of the carol "<a href="#OH_HAPPY_NIGHT">Oh, Happy Night</a>" on a
xylophone, behind the scenes.</p>

<h3>ACT I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span>: <i>Christmas Eve.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>The kitchen of a peasant cottage. Open fireplace<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
(R.) with large pot, hung from a crane, or standing directly upon the
logs. On the shelf above, small bowls and spoons. Beside fireplace,
a narrow exit leading to</i> <span class="smcap">Toinette's</span> <i>room: opposite, door
to other rooms. Outside door, R. Back. L. window. Down stage L. a low
table with small chairs, where the children sit for their supper,
used later by the Elves. Before the fire, a large old-fashioned
wooden rocker.</i></p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Mother</span> <i>bends over sewing, near window, from time to time
glancing at</i> <span class="smcap">Toinette</span>, <i>who sits dreamily gazing into the
fire.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Toinette! [<span class="smcap">Toinette</span>, <i>absorbed in thought,
apparently hears nothing.</i>] Toinette! Bless the child, is she asleep?
Toinette!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette</span> [<i>absently</i>]. Yes, Mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Come, Toinette, it is time to brush the hearth and
set the kettle on to boil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette</span> [<i>without moving</i>]. Yes'm, in a minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> [<i>sharply</i>]. Toinette, the dusk is coming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">-34-</a></span> It is
nearly supper-time, and the candle must be lit. Come, brush the floor
quickly, child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette</span> [<i>flinging impatiently out of her chair</i>]. I hate
to work! [<i>Sweeps slowly and absently, stopping to lean on her broom.
Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Marie</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Jeannette</span>, <i>with sewing and
book, and sit down on low chairs.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> Toinette, will you show me how to fasten this off?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette</span> [<i>who has been leaning on her broom, begins
suddenly to sweep</i>]. No, I won't. I'm busy sweeping.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> Oh, I didn't know you were busy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> What are your eyes for? Don't you see me sweeping?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> Well, you were standing still, and I just thought&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette</span> [<i>sweeping furiously</i>]. You're always "just
thinking" things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> I'm hungry, Mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Are you, dear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette</span> [<i>crossly, leaning on her broom</i>]. She's always
hungry. I never saw such a little pig.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie</span> [<i>putting her arms indignantly around</i>
<span class="smcap">Jeannette</span>]. No, she isn't at all. You're very unkind,
Toinette.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Hush, children. Don't quarrel. [<i>Shakes her head
sadly and looks perplexed.</i>]</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Pierre</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Marc</span>, <i>the latter with<br />
knife and bits of wood.</i> <span class="smcap">Marc</span> <i>sits down<br />
against the fireplace, whittling.</i> <span class="smcap">Pierre</span><br />
<i>lies at full length before the fire.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> Will you tell us a story, Toinette?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie</span> [<i>gently</i>]. Sh, dear, Toinette's busy, but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">-35-</a></span> wish
she would. She can tell such lovely fairy stories when she likes to.
And this is Christmas Eve, Jeannette. Perhaps the fairies are out,
looking for good children. Fairies are always helping St. Nicholas;
Toinette says so. I wish she would get done sweeping.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> When you get done, can't you tell just one story,
Toinette?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> Oh, it's so hard to keep thinking up stories
all the time. There now, Marc, you horrid boy, just see how you've
scattered chips all over my clean floor. And, Pierre, your old shoes
are just as dirty as they can be. What's the use of my sweeping,
Mother, when the boys are so careless?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Try to remember to brush your shoes next time,
Pierre. And, Marc, it's better not to bring the whittling into the
house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> I should think as much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pierre</span> [<i>getting up</i>]. I'm sorry I forgot, Mother. Come
along, Marc, we'll go out in the woodshed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marc</span> [<i>giving the chips a brush towards the fireplace with
his cap and then following</i> <span class="smcap">Pierre</span>]. It's pretty cold in the
woodshed. [<i>Looking resentfully at</i> <span class="smcap">Toinette</span>.] I'd rather be
cold than get scolded all the time. [<i>Exeunt boys.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> [<i>rises, lights candle, puts saucepan over the
fire</i>]. Now, Toinette, I have other work to do. Finish brushing
up [<span class="smcap">Toinette</span> <i>puts down broom</i>], and set the table. The
porridge is over the fire and will be done soon. If you would put
your mind on it, daughter, and work quickly, you would get done
quickly, and the work would not seem so hard. [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette</span> [<i>seizes a tablecloth and approaches the table</i>].
Work quickly! Marie, how ever can I set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">-36-</a></span> the table with you and
Jeannette in the way, I'd like to know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> We'll go in Mother's room, Toinette. [<i>Takes</i>
<span class="smcap">Jeannette</span> <i>by the hand. Exeunt.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette</span> [<i>covering table and slapping bowls and spoons
pettishly down upon it</i>]. Work quickly! Don't I work and work all
the time? And I'm never done. The work seems hard because it <i>is</i>
hard, that's why. Oh, if we weren't so poor, and didn't have to work
so hard! [<i>Relaxes her efforts and stands before the fire, dish in
hand.</i>] And if we could have beautiful Christmas presents to-morrow,
instead of just&mdash;anything. [<i>A very gentle knock at the door.</i>]
Oh, what was that? [<i>Opens.</i>] The boys must be playing tricks on
me. [<i>Knocks again.</i>] Surely, there is someone there. [<i>Opens door
and steps outside.</i> <span class="smcap">Hollyberry</span> <i>slips in behind her and
hides behind the door. Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Toinette</span>.] It must be the
fairies, I think. [<i>Stands looking out.</i>] This is Christmas Eve and
of course it's the right time for good fairies to be about. How I
wish I could see one!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry.</span> Do you, Toinette? Just open your eyes and you
will, then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette</span> [<i>jumping, rubs her eyes and looks about</i>]. Where?
Oh, where?</p>

<p class="right">
[<span class="smcap">Hollyberry</span> <i>comes from behind the door<br />
and makes a low bow.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette</span> [<i>clasping her hands with delight</i>]. Oh, are you
really a fairy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry</span> [<i>hands on hips</i>]. Yes, I think I'm a pretty real
sort of a fairy. We elves have heard you talking about us and you
always tell what's true, so we like you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">-37-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> Oh, I'm so glad, because I <i>love</i> fairies. The
children do too, and they are always teasing me to tell them fairy
tales.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry.</span> I am the leader of the band of elves. My name is
Hollyberry, and I've come with a message to you. I told you the elves
and fairies all like you. So we are going to give you a Christmas
present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> Oh, oh! how kind you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry</span> [<i>arms folded, nodding his head</i>]. Yes, we are.
Very kind. But people don't always think so. Toinette, how would you
like to be invisible?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> Invisible? Oh, do you mean to go around wherever I
like without being seen? Oh, what fun!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry.</span> That's exactly what I mean. <i>We</i> can do it, at
any time, because we know how. But mortals like you can only do it on
Christmas Eve, and then only when we help them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> Do you mean you are going to show me how?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry.</span> That's it. There are two things you must do.
First you must put fern seed in your shoes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> Fern seed? Why, I didn't even know ferns had
seeds. I never saw any.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry.</span> Of course not. The elves take very good care of
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> Where shall I get any?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry.</span> I'll attend to that. The second thing is to put
on the Cloak of Darkness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> The Cloak of Darkness! What is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry.</span> Don't be impatient, Toinette. [<i>Waves his holly
wand and snaps his fingers above his head. The door opens and the
other elves enter, carrying between them the gray cloak and a tiny
bag.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">-38-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elves</span> [<i>kneeling before</i> <span class="smcap">Toinette</span> <i>and presenting
bag and cloak</i>]. Hail, Toinette!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry</span> [<i>touching the kneeling elves as he names them</i>].
Evergreen and Mistletoe, present the magic Cloak of Darkness. Icicle,
yield the fairy fern seed. Now, Toinette, put a pinch of fern seed in
each shoe, wrap the cloak around you, and <i>then</i>,&mdash;well, nobody but
an elf can find you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistletoe.</span> The charm is only for to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry.</span> And if you get tired of it before bedtime&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evergreen.</span> Take off the cloak&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Icicle.</span> And empty your shoes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry.</span> And, presto! Toinette is herself again. Now,
farewell. [<i>All bow low and go to door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Icicle.</span> Good-by.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistletoe.</span> We'll take care of the cloak when you're done
with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evergreen.</span> We hope you'll like our Christmas present.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Exeunt elves, laughing mischievously.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette</span> [<i>looking after them</i>]. What cunning little
fellows! Oh, what fun. [<i>Examines cloak.</i>] I'll put it on right away.

[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mother</span> <i>(L.), going at once to the fire.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Why, where is Toinette? The porridge is almost
boiling over. Come, children,&mdash;Marie, Jeannette, boys. Supper is
ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> [<i>giving bread to children, who eat hungrily</i>]. Where
can Toinette be? Boys, have you seen her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marc.</span> No, Mother, she lets us alone when we keep out of her
way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> For shame, Marc. Pierre, go call her,&mdash;she may be in

<span class="smcap">Toinette</span>, <i>who stands in the way.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pierre</span> [<i>at door</i>]. Toinette! Toinette! We're at supper.
[<i>A moment's silence.</i> <span class="smcap">Toinette</span> <i>giggles.</i>] She isn't here,
Mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> I'm sure I heard her laughing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Listen. [<span class="smcap">Toinette</span> <i>covers her mouth to
stifle a laugh.</i> <span class="smcap">Pierre</span> <i>sits down again and eats.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette</span> [<i>aside</i>]. This is such fun. But I'm hungry,&mdash;how
am I going to get anything to eat? [<i>Goes close to the table and,
watching her chance, slips</i> <span class="smcap">Marc's</span> <i>bread off the table and
eats.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marc.</span> Where's my bread? You took it, Pierre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pierre.</span> I did not. Here's my own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> You must have dropped it on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marc</span> [<i>looking under chair</i>]. No, I didn't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> Well, you ate it, then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marc.</span> I never. [<span class="smcap">Toinette</span> <i>laughs silently.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Here's another piece. Never mind where that is gone.
I only wish Toinette had it. [<span class="smcap">Toinette</span> <i>nearly chokes.</i>] The
child must have gone out. I will go to the gate and look down the
road. [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> Poor Toinette's all gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marc.</span> Perhaps a bear has eaten her up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pierre.</span> If he has, I mean to ask Mother if I can't have her
room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> Marc, don't talk so, you'll frighten Jeannette.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marc.</span> Well, perhaps it's true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">-40-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> Well, you know you'd be sorry if it was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pierre.</span> I wouldn't be very sorry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie</span> [<i>horrified</i>]. Oh, you bad boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pierre.</span> Well, of course I don't want her to be <i>hurt</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marc.</span> But we wouldn't care much if she didn't come back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> Boys, how can you be so naughty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pierre.</span> But, Marie, Toinette never does a thing but scold us
when she's around.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> She tells us <i>beautiful</i> fairy stories sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marc.</span> That's just it&mdash;"sometimes." You don't catch her doing
it unless she wants to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pierre.</span> And she's just a regular old spoil-sport.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marc.</span> Oh, bother about Toinette. She'll come back a good
deal sooner than we want her. Can't you talk about anything else?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie</span> [<i>doubtfully</i>]. Well, it is pleasanter when she isn't
here, I know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pierre.</span> Of course it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> But I hope she's having a good time somewhere else.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> Oh, Mother, Mother! [<i>Buries her face in her

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> [<i>trying to raise her</i>]. Toinette, my child! Where
have you been all this time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette</span> [<i>with great excitement, half crying</i>]. Oh, I've
been here&mdash;right here&mdash;all the time, only you couldn't see me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Toinette!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> Yes, Mother, it's all true. I'll tell you. A fairy
came and lent me the Cloak of Darkness&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I thought it would
be such fun, but it was horrid. And then the children&mdash;they said such
cruel things. Mother, don't they love me at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Mercy, mercy, what is all this about?
Fairies&mdash;cloak of darkness&mdash;the child must have a fever. [<i>Feels</i>
<span class="smcap">Toinette's</span> <i>forehead and takes her hand as if to count her
pulse.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> No, no! I'm not sick at all. But, Mother, don't
you love me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> [<i>puts her arm about</i> <span class="smcap">Toinette</span>]. Love you,
my child? Mother <i>always</i> loves you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> But you said I didn't help you. Oh, I wish the
fairy had never given me the cloak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">-42-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Fairies again! [<i>Anxiously.</i>] I must put the child
to bed at once. Stay by the fire, Toinette. I will get your bed
ready. [<i>Rises, leaving</i> <span class="smcap">Toinette</span> <i>seated on the floor by
chair. Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Mother</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette</span> [<i>slowly</i>]. Mother thinks I dreamed it&mdash;or that
I'm sick. But I'm not. It's all true, it's all true. [<i>Covers her
face with her hands.</i>] How could the children be so unkind?...
But perhaps I'm not always kind to the children. The boys are so
provoking&mdash;but then I needn't scold them even if they are. And Marie
must care a little, for she hoped I was happy somewhere. Happy! How
can I be happy? [<i>Gazes at the fire.</i>] Perhaps if I began now, and
tried and tried every day, I could be kinder&mdash;to the children&mdash;and
then they would love me more&mdash;and I could try to help Mother&mdash;and
then she needn't be so tired all the time&mdash;&mdash; And surely, then I
would be happy. [<i>Brightly, facing audience, hands clasped on one
knee.</i>] Yes, that's just what I'll do. And now, perhaps I can help
Mother this very minute&mdash;&mdash; I'll take the candle up to her. [<i>Jumps
up, takes candle from table, pauses in center of the stage.</i>] It is
Christmas&mdash;I do think that if I begin to-morrow to try to be kind, I
will surely succeed. Because Christmas is the very best and happiest
day in all the whole year. It was on Christmas Day the angels first
sang about Peace on earth, good will to men.</p>

<h3>ACT II</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span>: <i>One year later. Christmas Eve.</i></p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>Curtain rises showing</i> <span class="smcap">Toinette</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Marie</span> <i>seated, sewing</i>; <span class="smcap">Jeannette</span> <i>sits upon the
floor, leaning against</i> <span class="smcap">Toinette's</span> <i>knee</i>; <span class="smcap">Marc</span>
<i>leans over the back of her chair</i>; <span class="smcap">Pierre</span> <i>sits in the big
chair rocking and looking on. All are singing a Christmas carol.
Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mother</span>, <i>pausing a moment in doorway to watch and
smile at the group.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Come, chickabiddies, it is time to stop work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie</span> [<i>going to</i> <span class="smcap">Mother</span>]. Oh, Mother, must we stop
now? Toinette was just going to tell us the Christmas story about the
Shepherds and the Star in the East.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> It is supper-time now, and Toinette must set the
table. [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pierre.</span> And after supper comes bedtime. Oh, dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette</span> [<i>cheerfully folding her work</i>]. Never mind,
Pierre, I'll tell it to you to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marc.</span> That'll be Christmas day, Toinette. I wish you could
tell it on Christmas Eve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> Oh, I think I can tell it better on Christmas day,
Marc. Now we all have something to do,&mdash;let's get to work. Who will
fetch water for me to-night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marc</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Pierre</span> [<i>springing for the pitcher</i>]. I
will, I will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marc.</span> It's my turn, Pierre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">-44-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pierre.</span> No, you nearly always get water for Toinette. I'm
going to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> Let Pierre get the water, Marc, and you go and cut
the wood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marc</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Pierre</span>. All right, Toinette. [<i>Exeunt.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> What can we do for you, Toinette, dear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> Nothing just now, I think. [<span class="smcap">Toinette</span> <i>is
spreading the cloth and setting the bowls and spoons.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jeannette.</span> But <i>we</i> want to help, too, dear Toinette.
[<i>Clings to her skirt.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> I'll tell you what. I'd rather send my two little
helpers in to see what they can do for poor busy Mother. She needs
them more than I do. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Jeannette</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie</span> [<i>following</i>]. Won't that be helping you too, Toinette?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> Yes, dear. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Marie</span>.] How good the
children are to-night! I do think they are the best brothers and
sisters a girl ever had. [<i>Lighting the candle.</i>] And I think they
love me more than they ever used to. Oh, I'm so glad! [<i>Tap at the
door.</i>] There is someone knocking. [<i>Goes to the door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry</span> [<i>bowing low</i>]. How do you do, Toinette? A Merry
Christmas to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> Oh, how wonderful. It's Hollyberry again, and I
was just thinking about you. Won't you come in?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry.</span> Just for a moment. [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Hollyberry</span>.
<span class="smcap">Toinette</span> <i>closes the door.</i>] I've brought you a Christmas
present, Toinette. [<i>Holds out cloak and fern-seed bag.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette</span> [<i>retreating, hands behind her</i>]. Oh, no, no, no!
I know what those are, and I don't want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">-45-</a></span> them. Oh! Hollyberry, they
made me so unhappy last year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry.</span> You didn't like the elves' gift, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> Oh, it was horrid&mdash;I <i>hated</i> it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry</span> [<i>severely</i>]. Do you call that being grateful?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette</span> [<i>confused</i>]. Oh, no&mdash;I mean, yes&mdash;that is, it was
very kind of you&mdash;but I didn't like it. Oh, dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry</span> [<i>kindly</i>]. Never mind, Toinette, I'm only
teasing you now. And I advise you to take the fern seed. You will
like it better this year, I'm sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette</span> [<i>anxiously</i>]. Truly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry.</span> Truly. [<span class="smcap">Toinette</span> <i>takes bag and
cloak.</i>] And if you like it we are going to ask a favor of you. We
want you to make us some fern-seed broth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> Fern-seed broth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry.</span> Yes, elves are very fond of it, but they don't
get any very often, because it has to be made over a fire, and you
see we're afraid of fire. We're so little and light, we might be
blown in and burned up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette.</span> But how shall I make it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry.</span> It's very easy. We'll show you how. And now,
good-by. We'll come in by and by when the children are in bed. [<i>Exit
with a bow.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette</span> [<i>looking gravely at cloak and bag</i>]. Oh, do I dare
use them? I have tried to be kinder&mdash;I know the children love me
more&mdash;&mdash; Yes, I will. [<i>Runs out. Boys singing carol in the distance.
Enter boys singing, with pitcher and wood. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mother</span>,
<span class="smcap">Marie</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Jeannette</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Why, the supper is all ready, but where is that busy
bee of ours, Toinette? [<i>Goes to door as if to call.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">-46-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pierre</span> [<i>catches her arm</i>]. Oh, Mother, wait a moment; don't
call her yet! You know we've made her some Christmas gifts, and we
want to put them on her plate and surprise her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Run and get them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marc</span> [<i>under his breath</i>]. Hurry, quick, everybody.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Exit children in haste.</i> <span class="smcap">Mother</span> <i>takes saucepan<br />

at the table, sitting with folded hands until<br />

<i>enters, dressed in cloak, and stands<br />
near door (R.), her hands clasped in<br />
pleasure at the sight.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marc</span> [<i>looking towards the door</i>]. Oh, I wish Toinette would
hurry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> Won't she be surprised?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pierre.</span> And won't she <i>look</i> jolly surprised, too? I love to
see Toinette when she's surprised. Her eyes get so big and shiny, and
she just stares.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marc.</span> Andrew, the blacksmith's son, thinks his sister is
prettier than our Toinette, but <i>I</i> don't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pierre</span> [<i>in great scorn</i>]. Aw! I should think not. Our
Toinette is just the prettiest girl in the village.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> And the very nicest, too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> [<i>smiling</i>]. And Toinette is Mother's right hand. We
all love Toinette! Don't we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Toinette</span> [<i>softly</i>]. Oh, the dear little things! I can't
wait a minute longer. [<i>Exit quickly.</i>]</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry.</span> It's very simple, but it must be made with great
care.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistletoe.</span> You must always stir it the same way!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evergreen.</span> Or else it will curdle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Icicle.</span> And you must <i>never</i> let it scorch!</p>

<h3>NOTES ON COSTUME AND SETTING</h3>

<p>The children are dressed in peasant costumes, the girls in bright
skirts and stockings, white guimpes, black velvet bodices, and
Normandy caps; the boys in full trousers, bright stockings, vests of
green or blue, fastening in the back, white shirts with full sleeves,
and toboggan caps. Toinette wears shoes with buckles; the others may
wear the same, or sabots.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Plain dark dress, with full skirt; kerchief on her
shoulders, and a white cap.</p>

<p>The magic "Cloak of Darkness" brought by the Elves for Toinette, is a
long cape, with hood attached, made of light gray canton flannel.</p>

<p>The Fern-seed Bag may be made of a bit of the same material, or of
the colors of Hollyberry's costume.</p>

<p>The Elves wear harlequin costumes in two shades of the same color,
with tall pointed hoods, and long shoes with toes turned up. Gilt
bells on all points of collar, jacket, and hood. See illustration.
Sateen is perhaps the best material for these little suits, as it
comes in a great variety of rich shades, but cheaper goods may be
found.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hollyberry.</span> Dark red and scarlet. He carries a holly branch
in lieu of a wand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistletoe.</span> Brown and yellow. In Act II he carries an odd box
supposed to be full of fern seed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evergreen.</span> Dark and light green. In Act II he produces the
holly stick for stirring the broth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Icicle.</span> Dark and light blue. In Act II he carries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">-51-</a></span> a small
jar or pitcher,&mdash;something curious or unusual in appearance,&mdash;which
is supposed to contain the honey-dew.</p>

<p>Instead of the gilt bells, the points of these suits may be trimmed
with bits of holly, mistletoe, evergreen, and glass icicles, as
indicated by the names.</p>

<p>In setting the stage, it is effective to make small windows, with
diamond-shaped panes, and white sash-curtains, placing small pots of
scarlet geraniums on the sills.</p>

<p>The song is "Good News on Christmas Morning," from <i>St. Nicholas
Songs</i> (Century Company).</p>

<p>Where music is indicated through the play, any part of the carol is
sung, except the last verse, which is used only once, just before the
last curtain. For the Elves' dance, the Pizzicato from the ballet
"Sylvia" by Delibes, Dvorak's "Humoresque," or a waltz, very lightly
played, may be used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I just can't believe that to-morrow really will be

<p><span class="smcap">Phil</span> [<i>driving a last nail into a bootjack</i>]. Papa says he
can't get his new boots off. If he can't do it now, with this, I'm
sure he never will be able to. Isn't that fine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> Sure, Master Phil, he'll be wantin' a new house to
kape that big thing in!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Now, Sarah, you mustn't say that! You know Papa

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> You bet! I'm going to do Papa's knife up in a great big
bundle, so he'll think it's a pair of slippers or a book, anyway, and
see how surprised he'll be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span> [<i>clapping his hands</i>]. What fun! Say, Tom, don't
you wish we could <i>see</i> Santa Claus?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">-56-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Let's try and stay awake all night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> No! you bad boys! Santa Claus doesn't like to have
children see him when he comes to put things in the stockings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> No, of course he doesn't. And, besides, Mamma has a
better way. She told me to ask you all whether you would rather hang
your stockings this year, or get Santa Claus to come and bring us a
tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie.</span> Oh, jolly! But how is Santa Claus going to know in
time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> That's what I'd like to know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I asked Papa that, and he said, Oh, he guessed he
could telegraph.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Then do let's have him come here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Children.</span> Oh, yes, let's!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> I want to thank him for my dolly's bed that he brought
last year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Well, I'll go tell Mamma. [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> Ye'd all better come down and wrap up yer things now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> All right. Come along. [<i>Exeunt all but</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> I'll be along in a minute. [<i>Looks up chimney.</i>] I'm
so glad Santa Claus is coming this year. [<i>Crosses to front of stage
and sits astride a small chair with its back to audience.</i>] There are
so many things I want to know about him. I'm just going to count.
[<i>Checks off on his fingers.</i>] First, I want to know where he lives.
Daisy says he lives at the North Pole, and she's got a picture of
his house, with icicles and snow all over it. But then he always
brings us oranges and bananas and nuts and figs, and I know <i>they</i>
don't grow at the North Pole. I wish I could find out. Next, what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">-57-</a></span>
feeds the reindeer on. Next, how he ever gets all the things into
the sleigh. How fast the reindeer can go. And whether they ever get
balky. He'd be late all the time if they did. Horses do, but perhaps
reindeer are different. But the one thing I'd rather know than all
the others put together, is just this: Sarah <i>said</i>, the other day
when I took a bite out of one of her hot pies, that Santa Claus
[<i>very slowly and impressively</i>] would put a whip in my stocking!
Now I wonder if he would do that? [<i>Thinks awhile, then shakes his
head.</i>] No, no! I don't believe he would. He's always smiling in his
pictures, and he looks so jolly. And then, if anybody wanted to spend
all his time giving presents, like Santa Claus, I don't believe he
would ever put ashes or whips in anybody's stocking, just because
he forgot the pie was for company.... Oh, dear! I wish I did know.
[<i>Jumps up suddenly, puts one knee on the chair, and holds on to the
back with both hands.</i>] Oh! Oh! I've got such a splendid plan! It'll
be easy enough to find out, after all. I don't really want anything
for Christmas this year ... 'cept maybe a sled, and ... well, I guess
Phil will let me coast on his sled. Now, I'm going to be just as
cross, <i>as cross as a bear</i>, to-night and <i>see</i> if Santa Claus will
give me a whip. I don't care&mdash;I know he won't! Anyway, Mamma never
lets anybody whip me&mdash;only Papa&mdash;and if Santa Claus wants me whipped
he'll have to give the whip to Papa. There! I hear somebody coming.
I'm just going to begin right off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span> [<i>calling, without</i>]. Tom, Tom! Aren't you coming to
wrap up your things?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> [<i>very crossly</i>]. No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span> [<i>much surprised</i>]. <i>Why</i> not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Don't want to. [<i>Chuckles.</i>] He sounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">-58-</a></span> rather
surprised. I guess they won't know what to make of it. It'll be such
fun! [<i>Sits astride chair again.</i>] Here comes somebody else. I won't
look around. [<i>Puts his head down on his arms. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Dot</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Tom!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> What do you want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot</span> [<i>timidly</i>]. What's the matter, Tom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Ain't nothing the matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot</span> [<i>aside</i>]. Oh, dear! Tom, do you want me to wrap up the
knife for you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Can if you want to. Here. [<i>Takes it from his pocket
and hands it to her without looking up.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot</span> [<i>aside</i>]. What can be the matter? We can't any of us be
happy if Tom isn't. [<i>Exit, putting her handkerchief to her eyes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> Well, what's the matter wid yerself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Never you mind what! [<i>The other children run in.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh, Sarah, Sarah, give us our coats, quick! Papa says
he'll take us along Fourth Street, to see the shop windows lighted up!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie.</span> Do hurry, Sarah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I can't find my mittens!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot</span> [<i>softly, nudging</i> <span class="smcap">Phil</span>]. Phil, tell Tom to

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Don't want to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Well, you can have it for all me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> See here, Tom, don't be a donkey! Come along! [<i>Takes
him by the arm.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> [<i>shakes him off</i>]. Get out!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Well, I suppose we'll have to go without him. Papa is
waiting. [<i>They start.</i>] Phil, what is the matter with Tom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> I don't know. Dot said he was cross&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Exeunt.</i><br />

Claus to make it out of rattan, Master Tom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Go on out, I say! [<i>Chases her out.</i>] Well, it's
some fun to be cross to Sarah, but I really don't like to be cross
to Dot and the others. Oh, dear! I wish I didn't have to. [<i>Sees</i>
<span class="smcap">Sarah's</span> <i>dust-cloth, which he rolls into a wad and tucks
into a cap lying on one of the chairs.</i>] He-he! that'll fix her. Now
she can't find it. [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sarah</span>. <span class="smcap">Tom</span> <i>sits down

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> Oh, my clearin'-up's not done yet! I de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">-60-</a></span>clare, if
I've redd up this room once, I've done it forty times this day.
[<i>Straightens things, then looks for her duster.</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>

know I didn't. Where did I put it, then? 'Tain't here annywheres.
Maybe that little squirrel hid it. Seen my duster, Tom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> No, I don't see your duster.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> Did I ax ye if ye saw it now? I said, have ye sane it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> And I said I didn't see it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah.</span> Well, ye little fox, I know yer tricks, and I'll find
it yet. Them as hides, finds, but sometimes other folks can find,
too, when they know who did the hiding. Ah! what did I tell ye! I've
got it at last. I knew ye put it somewheres. Now I can get my work
done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Well, don't you bother me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah</span> [<i>stands with hands on hips, looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>,

<h3>ACT II</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span>: <i>Christmas morning.</i></p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>Sitting-room with open fire [back Center] in
fireplace through which</i> <span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> <i>may enter.</i>
<span class="smcap">Father</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mother</span> <i>sitting by fire</i>,
<span class="smcap">Father</span> <i>with paper</i>, <span class="smcap">Mother</span> <i>sewing.</i> <span class="smcap">Phil</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Charlie</span> <i>in one corner [R. Front], reading together.</i>
<span class="smcap">Daisy</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dot</span> <i>[L. Front] with dolls.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> And I caught Mamma! I hid behind the door, and jumped
out and shouted "Merry Christmas!" before she saw me at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot</span> [<i>leaning towards</i> <span class="smcap">Daisy</span>]. Daisy, let's say it
to Santa Claus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh, do you suppose he would like it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Yes, I guess he would. Dear Santa Claus, nobody ever
thinks of saying "Merry Christmas" to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Poor man! Well, Daisy, his little boys and girls might
say it to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh, Dot! He hasn't any little boys and girls to say
it. Don't you know he's an old man, oh, hundreds of years old? And if
he ever did have any little boys and girls, they're all grown up by
this time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Maybe he's got some grandchildren.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> No, I don't believe he has, for then why do they let
him do all the work? Nobody ever fills stockings but Santa Claus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">-63-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Poor Santa Claus! He must get very tired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> I wonder ... I wonder who keeps house for Santa Claus?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Maybe nobody does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh, yes! He must have somebody to make his fires, and
cook his meals, and darn his socks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Why, he doesn't wear socks. Don't you know, he's all
dressed in fur in the pictures. But perhaps fur wears out and has to
be mended. I'd like to help her do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Perhaps she's a real cross, ugly woman, and scolds
him when he stays out too long filling stockings, and doesn't give
him enough sugar in his tea, and never lets him have but one cup!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot</span> [<i>shaking her head</i>]. Poor Santa Claus! Aren't you sorry
for him, Daisy? I am. [<span class="smcap">Daisy</span> <i>nods.</i>] Daisy, if he hasn't
any little children, I don't suppose anybody ever gives him any
Christmas presents?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy</span> [<i>pityingly</i>]. No, I don't suppose anyone ever does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot</span> [<i>excitedly</i>]. Oh, Daisy, let's <i>us</i> give him a present
this year!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Oh, how splendid! Of course we will. But what do you
think he would like?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Let's think. He travels all the time. Perhaps he would
like a comb and brush case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Dot! You don't suppose he can ever comb out all that
hair! It's a great deal too thick and snarly. He doesn't use a comb
and brush.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Well, I'll give him my new purse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> Santa Claus doesn't need a pocketbook to carry
money&mdash;he doesn't buy things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> But he might come to a toll-gate on the road, sometime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">-64-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> All right. And I'll give him my silk muffler, for I'm
afraid his housekeeper doesn't give him enough warm clothes. Come,
let's get them. [<i>Exeunt.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie.</span> What's this picture about, Phil?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> That's where Santa Claus is coming down our chimney.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie.</span> I wonder why he likes to come down chimneys? I'd
have a latchkey, and come in at the front door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Everybody doesn't have a front door just like ours,
Charlie. His key wouldn't fit all the doors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie.</span> But I'd have a magic key, that did. When Papa
shaves, and puts that white stuff all over his face, he looks just
like Santa Claus, but he wouldn't look like him long if he put his
head up the chimney. Santa Claus must get very dirty,&mdash;perhaps he
looks like the chimney-sweep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> Oh, no, he doesn't. You'll see how he looks pretty
soon. Come along, let's try our new sleds.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Exeunt.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> My dear, I want to speak to you. [<span class="smcap">Father</span>
<i>drops paper.</i>] Sarah tells me that Tom has been very naughty and
cross. He wouldn't do as she told him, and was disagreeable to the
other children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> Tom! Why, he's the best-tempered chicken I've got.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> I believe you think so just because he's named after
you. But he is really dreadfully provoking sometimes, and I don't
know what to do with him now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> Oh, ho! You've given up in despair, and want to fall
back on me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Not at all. But I'd like your advice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">-65-</a></span> Would you pay
no attention to it, or would you take him to task for his naughtiness?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> Mary, I always told you you couldn't manage the
boys. You are too gentle and yielding. You are never strict enough.
You ought to be firm, my dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Firm like yourself? Oh, Tom, who was it that
wouldn't punish the boys when they played truant, and pretended to
know nothing about it when they went in swimming unbeknownst?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> Oh, well, Mary, you couldn't expect me to be hard on
them for the very things I did myself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> I knew I couldn't, so I attended to them myself.
But I'll just send Tom in here, and let you try your luck with him.
[<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> Try my luck, indeed! I flatter myself that I'll soon
bring him around. [<i>Stands before fire. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>, <i>very

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> See here, Tom, we can't have this. Your mother says
you haven't been very good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Don't care.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> Thomas, that is not a respectful way to speak to
your father. What do you mean by it, sir? [<i>No answer.</i>] Do you mean
to tell me? [<span class="smcap">Tom</span> <i>is silent, and stands looking down and
kicking the leg of a chair.</i>] Go upstairs and stay there until I send

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> Ah, here's Mary again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Well, what did you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> I&mdash;a&mdash;I scolded him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> What did he say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> He said&mdash;well&mdash;in fact, he didn't say anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Wouldn't, you mean. Did you punish him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> Punish him? No, I didn't punish him. Come, now,
Mary, you don't mean to say you want me to punish him on Christmas
morning? I really couldn't do that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Oh, no, I don't want you to punish him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> Well, my dear, on the whole, I think perhaps <i>you'd</i>
better talk to him. I'll send him down.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Exit.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> I didn't think Tom could do much with that boy when
he was contrary. [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>.] Well, Tom, dear, don't you
want to come and sit with Mamma a little while?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> [<i>rather doubtfully</i>]. Ye-es.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Here is your little chair all ready. [<span class="smcap">Tom</span>

Sarah has told me something that makes me sorry. She said that you
were naughty last night? Is that so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> [<i>reluctantly</i>]. Yes, I was cross.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> She said you were cross again this morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Yes, I was naughty this morning, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Oh-h-h, Tommy! I'm so sorry to have my little boy so
naughty on Christmas Day. Don't you think that when people want to be
happy and glad, everyone ought to be good and pleasant, too?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">-67-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> [<i>the words drawn out against his will</i>]. Yes, I think
so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> And then there is the beautiful story of that
wonderful first Christmas. Don't you think people were very happy on
that Day? And you know we always think of that on Christmas, now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Oh, yes, I do too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> [<i>reproachfully</i>]. Then, Tom, how <i>could</i> you be so
naughty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Well, Mamma, do you think it's so <i>dread</i>fully naughty
to be cross?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> It is not so naughty as some things you might do,
but it is making other people unhappy, and don't you think that is
pretty bad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Well, Mamma, if a fellow didn't <i>feel</i> cross at all,
but had a very good reason for <i>being</i> cross, would that be naughty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> I don't think there can be any good reason for being
cross.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> It's a secret. It's a <i>very</i> good reason. I'm sorry
it's naughty. I didn't think it was. But <i>I'm not sorry I did it</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Oh, Tommy, it makes me feel badly to hear you talk
so. I'll leave you here, and let you think it over. Perhaps you'll
feel pleasanter after awhile. You can call me when you do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> [<i>leaving his little chair for a big one</i>]. I'm sorry
they all think I'm so bad, and I'm really very tired of being cross,
but I <i>must</i> find out about Santa Claus, for if he's the kind of man
that would bring anybody ashes or whips on Christmas, I don't believe
I'll like him at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">-68-</a></span> all! [<i>Jingling of bells in chimney.</i>] What's that?
[<i>Louder bells.</i>] I do believe he's coming now! [<i>Jumps up.</i>] Oh,
dear! where are the others? I wish they would come! I&mdash;I&mdash;I guess I'm
just a <i>little bit</i> afraid! [<i>Gets behind his chair. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Santa
Claus</span> <i>through the fireplace.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> That's a fine wide chimney! [<i>Stoops to look up
it.</i>] Why doesn't everybody keep a chimney like that for my special
use? [<i>Comes front.</i>] I'm sure when I only come once a year, I ought
to have some attention paid to my wants!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> [<i>faintly</i>]. Santa Claus!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Hello! What's this? Where are you, anyway?
[<i>Looks about, then over chair, and sees</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>.] What! Hiding
from me? Come out at once, and tell me what's the matter with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> [<i>coming out</i>]. Santa Claus, have you got the whip and
ashes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Whip and ashes! Bless me, what's the boy
talking about? Whip? I left my sleigh whip on the roof, if that's
what you mean, and I never carry <i>ashes</i> around with me. What are you
driving at? Hey?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> Sarah said you gave whips to bad boys, and I've been
very naughty&mdash;oh, dreadfully naughty!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Naughty? Dear, dear! I'm sorry to hear that!
And on Christmas, too! What a pity! When you knew I was coming? Dear,
dear, dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> <i>Have</i> you got the whip, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> No, no! I never give anybody whips&mdash;excepting
toy ones, with a whistle in the end, like this&mdash;&mdash; [<i>gives</i>
<span class="smcap">Tom</span> <i>one</i>] &mdash;&mdash;and Sarah was just teasing you. I'll have
to see Sarah about that. I won't have anybody telling stories about
me. But, dear, dear, it makes me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">-69-</a></span> unhappy to think you could be so
naughty. Why did you do it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> [<i>looks around cautiously</i>]. Don't tell anybody, Santa
Claus, but I was naughty on purpose, just to see if you would give me
a whip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Well, that's a joke! Don't you know enough to
see that you ought to have waited to ask me, instead of running such
a risk?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> [<i>remorsefully</i>]. Sure enough! I could have done that!
And now I've gone and made them all feel sorry, just for nothing.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Father</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mother</span>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> Well, well, here's Santa Claus! I haven't seen you
for a long time. How do you do, sir, how do you do? [<i>They shake
hands.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> [<i>at door</i>]. Children! Children! Come here!</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Enter children.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Children.</span> Oh, Santa Claus! Santa Claus!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dot</span>. Merry Christmas, Santa Claus!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span> We've got some presents for you, Santa Claus. Dot and
I thought nobody would remember to give you anything, so we wanted
to. [<i>Giving presents.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Well, really, my dears, these are very nice.
Bless your little hearts, nobody has remembered me for some time,
and that's a fact! Mr. Wright, how have these children been behaving
themselves? Can I give them the nice things I have brought for them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> Yes, sir! I'm happy to say, they have been very
good, very good, indeed. Oh&mdash;&mdash; [<i>aside</i>] &mdash;&mdash;now I'm forgetting that
rascal, Tom! [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span>.] That is&mdash;they've all been
good except one&mdash;and he&mdash;a&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> [<i>looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Tom</span>]. He is sorry now, I hope,
Santa Claus, and will try not to do so any more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">-70-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Oh! Ha-ha! you're talking about this fellow,
are you? [<i>Puts his hand on</i> <span class="smcap">Tom's</span> <i>shoulder and draws him
forward.</i>] Well, he's just been explaining to me that it was all a
mistake&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father</span> [<i>sternly</i>]. I hope he has not been trying to hide
his misdoings from you, Santa Claus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Not at all, sir, not at all. He confessed like
a man. But there is this about it that you didn't know. Somebody told
him that I put whips in the stockings of naughty children. Well, he
naturally thought I was to be distrusted&mdash;shocking way to malign me,
wasn't it?&mdash;and of course he wanted to find out. So what did he do to
test me but <i>try</i> to be naughty&mdash;acted it out to perfection, I've no
doubt. Pretty severe on his brothers and sisters and parents, wasn't
it? [<span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Father</span> <i>laugh.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Why, Tommy, it's a pity you didn't just come to me
and ask about it. It would have saved so much trouble. Why didn't you
do that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> I never once thought of that way, Mamma!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Well, my son, your thinking-cap is the only
cap you don't have to take off in the house, so remember to keep
it on, next time. Mr. Wright, I'm sure he feels sorry enough about
his mistake to justify me in giving him his full share of presents.
Come, children, look and see what I've got for you. I brought it last
night, to have it all ready, and I think it ought to hold enough for
all, don't you?</p>

<h3>NOTES ON COSTUME AND SETTING</h3>

<p>For this play, ordinary costume is all that is required. Adult parts
are taken by two girls and a boy, of fourteen or fifteen, and these,
of course, need something especial, but little girls can easily
borrow their equipment from mothers or sisters. Father Wright should
wear a mustache and, if desired, a beard.</p>

<p>For Santa Claus costume, see note, <a href="#Page_313">p. 313</a>.</p>

<h2>THEIR CHRISTMAS PARTY</h2>

<h3>ACT I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span>: <i>Afternoon of the 24th of December.</i></p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>A street corner on a snowy day. Barrels and boxes
in front of a small grocery store. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Dick</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Dot</span>, <i>well wrapped up, dragging a sled.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Whew! that's a dandy coast, but it's pretty hard work
pulling up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Let's sit down a minute and rest. [<i>They draw sled to
left of stage and sit down side by side on it.</i>] I'm so tired. Oh,
Dick, I thought we were going to run over that poor gray cat, didn't
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> [<i>nodding</i>]. It's lucky for her that she knew how
to jump. The Comet would have hit her sure! This rope needs tying
tighter. [<i>Goes to front of sled and kneels down, fixing rope.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot</span> [<i>looking around</i>]. It's so nice and quiet here. No big
boys ever coast on this street. Big boys always bump into you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> [<i>shaking his mitten at her</i>]. Now, Dot, that's just
the very reason I don't like it. You don't know how much more fun it
would be to have just lots and lots of boys on this track all the
time, climbing up and whizzing down. I bet none of them could beat
this old sled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot</span> [<i>doubtfully</i>]. Maybe it would be nice, but, Dick, I
think it's such fun to have just us two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> That's just because you're a girl and don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">-76-</a></span> know.
Come along, let's try the hill again. Shall we go over the bump?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> No, I'm afraid. Let's start down here.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Exeunt.</i><br />
<br />
[<i>Enter from Left</i>, <span class="smcap">Jim</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Polly</span>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim.</span> If you're very cold, Sister, we can go home right off
now, but I've got four papers left, and I want awful bad to sell 'em,
every one, so's I can take the money to Granny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> No, I'm not so dreadful cold, Jim. And, 'sides, maybe
Granny's not got home yet from work, and then you know we'd just have
to sit on the doorstep and wait.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim.</span> We'll stay right here. Folks will be going home soon,
and lots of men pass this corner. Here's a nice box to sit on; I
don't believe the store man will mind. You sit on that side, so,
Polly, and I'll sit here, so, for the wind's blowing this way, and if
I sit here it will hit me first, and I can keep it off o' you. [<i>They
sit back to back on the box.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Oh, Jim, I'm afraid you'll be cold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim.</span> Oh, no, I won't. [<i>Two men cross stage arm in arm.</i>]
Here's your Times, Star, Evening Post. Last edition. [<i>Men shake
their heads.</i>] [<i>Looking after men.</i>] Pshaw! Well, maybe the next
feller'll want one. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Polly</span>.] See, Polly, I can't be
cold, I just stuff my hands in my pockets&mdash;&mdash; [<i>His hand comes
through.</i>] No, that's the wrong place. I just stuff my hands in my
pockets like this, and then I kick my heels like this. [<i>Kicks on box
with his heels.</i>] That's very warming. And then I whistle. [<i>Whistles
lively tune.</i>] If you just whistle you don't have time to think about
the wind, see!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">-77-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly</span> [<i>drums with her heels and tries to whistle</i>]. But it
hurts to kick your heels, and I can't whistle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim.</span> I'll tell you what. Let's try singing. Perhaps that's
just as warming. Let's sing Granny's Christmas song. [<i>They sing a
verse of "God rest ye, merry gentlemen," or some other old-world
carol.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Jim, is to-morrow Christmas?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim</span> [<i>gloomily</i>]. Yes, to-morrow's Christmas. [<i>Aside.</i>] And
if somebody don't buy these papers pretty soon, I won't have enough
pennies to get [<i>counts on his fingers</i>] that penny paper doll; nor
the penny washtub, nor the jumping Jack, nor the paint box, 'cause
that's three cents. [<i>Enter man.</i>] Here's your evenin' paper, sir!
[<i>Man stops and takes one. Exit.</i>]</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Dick</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dot</span>, <i>cross stage, and sit<br />
down as before.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Wasn't that a nice coast, Dick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> [<i>absently</i>]. Yes. [<i>Rests his chin in his hands and
elbows on his knees.</i>] Dot, I do wish we lived in an orphan asylum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot</span> [<i>jumps</i>]. Oh-h! Why, Dicky Browne, you wouldn't have
any papa nor mamma nor Aunt Jennie, nor anybody, nor anybody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> But just think what lots of brothers and sisters we'd
have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Well, you're all the brothers I want; 'nd I wouldn't
give up Papa and Mamma for all the sisters in the world; so now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Well, neither would I, but can't you see how much
nicer times we would have if there was a lot of us, on holidays
especially?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Well, I think we have an awfully good time, anyway. You
said you liked Thanksgiving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">-78-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> That was because of the dinner part. When we tried to
play games and dance afterwards, what did we do? We played Hide the
Thimble, and if I hid it there was only you to look, and of course
you couldn't help finding it first. We had to play Going to Jerusalem
with just one chair, and the two of us went around and around and
around till we felt like the "Little Rid Hin" in John's story. I
declare there aren't enough of us to play Puss-in-the-corner. Two
children can't have any fun. [<i>Puts his head down on his arms.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot</span> [<i>sighs</i>]. That's so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> [<i>lifts up his head suddenly</i>]. And I'd just like to
know what's the fun of coasting when you haven't anything to shout
"clear the track" at, but ash barrels, and hens and cats that you
can't run over anyway. I wish there were forty-'leven boys on the
track this minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Well, I don't care about the track, but brothers and
sisters are nice to play with. Wouldn't it be nice if there were two
of you and two of me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Two of us! I wish there were six of each of us. I
wish I could go and live with the Ruggles's, in your story about the
"Birds' Christmas Carol." There were nine of them and they only got
washed about once a year. And folks weren't always saying, "Land!
where did you get them dirty hands?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> That would be fun! We could play just as untidy
games&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Don't talk about it, it makes me cross. [<i>Folds his
arms, crosses his feet, and whistles something sad.</i> <span class="smcap">Dot</span>
<i>gets out her handkerchief and spreads it in her lap.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim</span> [<i>softly</i>]. I say, Polly, that boy's got an awful nice
sled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">-79-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Just look at his sister's muff. [<i>Enter man.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim</span> [<i>shouts</i>]. Buy a paper, sir! [<i>Man takes paper.</i>]</p>

<p class="right">
[<span class="smcap">Dot</span> <i>turns and sees children, looks away, then<br />
back again, turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Dick</span>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Dicky, are you sure you are warm enough?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Warm enough! How could I be cold with a great big coat
like this one? I feel like a polar bear. [<i>Walks up and down to show
size of his coat, then sits down.</i> <span class="smcap">Dot</span> <i>turns and sees the
children's ragged shoes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> But are your feet warm?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Of course, with boots on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot</span> [<i>sees</i> <span class="smcap">Polly</span> <i>examining holes in her
mittens</i>]. But aren't there any holes in your mittens?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> In my spick-span new mittens that Aunt Jennie made
me? [<i>Holds them up.</i>] Dot, you're crazy! [<i>Catches her looking at
the children; looks himself, and then walks around the sled to sit
facing</i> <span class="smcap">Jim</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Polly</span>. <span class="smcap">Dot</span> <i>does the
same. All four stare in silence.</i>] Hullo!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim.</span> Hullo, yourself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Are you the boy that my papa gets his papers of?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim.</span> Don't know.</p>

<p class="right">
[<span class="smcap">Dot</span> <i>walks decidedly over to</i> <span class="smcap">Polly</span>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Let me feel your hands. They're just like ice; I
knew it. Put them right in here with mine. [<i>Kneels in front of</i>
<span class="smcap">Polly</span> <i>and puts her hands in muff.</i> <span class="smcap">Dick</span> <i>moves
sled close to</i> <span class="smcap">Jim</span> <i>and sits astride of it.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Have you sold all your papers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim.</span> No, I've got two left.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Isn't it lots of fun to sell papers and earn money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim.</span> I don't know,&mdash;not this kind of weather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> I think it would be fun. I wouldn't want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">-80-</a></span> sell 'em
on Christmas. Do you have to work on Christmas day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim.</span> Not if I don't want to. I did go out last Christmas,
but nobody much came along. I suppose they stayed at home to keep
warm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> No, I guess Santa Claus was coming to see their little
children, and they wanted to see him too. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Polly</span>.] What
do you want Santa Claus to bring you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Santa Claus hasn't ever been to our house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> What, hasn't ever been to your house!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Haven't you ever seen him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim.</span> No, she never saw him, but I saw a stuffed Santa Claus
in a window once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Why, he comes to our house every single year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> I thought he went to everybody's houses in this world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim</span> [<i>leaning toward</i> <span class="smcap">Dick</span> <i>and speaking low</i>]. I
get Polly presents when I get enough money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> But doesn't Santa Claus fill your stockings?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim.</span> No, and he never goes to Nicky Smith's house, nor Eddy
Warren's, nor Jakey White's. They told me so. Here comes another man.
Post, sir? [<i>Man shakes his head.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> Jim got me some candy last Christmas, and Granny gave
me a doll, only its head came off the next day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim.</span> That's an awful nice sled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Haven't you got any sled?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim.</span> No, but I coast on a board sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> I'll let you try Comet. Don't you want to take Polly
down?</p>

right through you, I tell you, when you go down that hill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Oh, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim.</span> We're much obliged for the sled, but we can't take your
things; you'll be cold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> No, we won't, and you must. [<i>Helps him on with his
own coat.</i>] You see, you're cold now, and you won't have a good coast
if you're not warm. Give me your cap. Here, take my mittens. Dot,
take Polly's shawl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Now, we'll sit right down here. Dick, you hold the
papers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Yes, lots. Have you got the papers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Yes, there are only two left to sell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Let me get close up behind you, the way Polly did. Now
you must drum with your heels, and whistle like Jim. [<span class="smcap">Dick</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Here comes somebody. Now I'm going to call. Here's
your evening papers, last edition!</p>

[<i>Enter two men, stop and buy a paper.</i><br />

<p><span class="smcap">First Man</span> [<i>looking back</i>]. That's a queer-looking newsboy.
Somehow he looks like a rich child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Man</span> [<i>pulling him off</i>]. I can't see but the
little scamp is ragged enough. Some of these newsboys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">-82-</a></span> aren't so

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> I've seen that man somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> I think he's been to see Papa. Wouldn't it be fun if
Papa came along and bought a paper of you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> And didn't know me. What a circus! Wish he would.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> There come Jim and Polly. Wave your paper at them.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim.</span> Good for you. It was fine!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> It was just grand!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Try it again. We like this, don't we, Dot?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Yes. Don't you want to go again, Polly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim.</span> Are you warm enough? honest Injun?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Yes, go on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim.</span> All right. [<i>Exeunt.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> I knew Jim would think Comet was a boss sled. Don't
you think Jim would be a nice brother, Dot?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Yes, if he washed his face. Polly would be nice for a
sister, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> We could all write letters to Santa Claus together.
[<i>Drums with heels and whistles.</i>]</p>

<p>Dot [<i>after a pause, rubbing her nose</i>]. Well, if Santa Claus's nose
ever feels like mine, it's no wonder it's red.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> [<i>squirming</i>]. Somehow, it's colder than I thought it
was. The thermometer must be down to zero.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> I'm sure it's nineteen below. I&mdash;I think a fire would
feel real nice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> I'll take you home when they come up again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">-83-</a></span> I'm not
very cold. I wonder if Jim ever flops his arms like a street car
driver. Maybe that would make him warm. Try it, Dot. [<i>Both beat
themselves with their arms.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> I don't believe anything would make me warm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Oh, no, I'm not going to cry.</p>

We've got to go home now. [<i>Changing coats.</i>] Jim, I think it's very
queer about Santa Claus. Is your house hard to find?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim.</span> No, it's just right down this street, there on
Friendship Alley. We're awfully much obliged for the ride. The
Comet's a beauty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polly.</span> I never was on a sled before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span>: <i>Christmas morning.</i></p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>Sitting-room, with large old-fashioned fireplace<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
[back Center]. Toys scattered about. A small blackboard to left of
fireplace.</i> <span class="smcap">Dick</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dot</span> <i>sitting in little
chairs.</i> <span class="smcap">Dick</span>, <i>with a knife, whittling.</i> <span class="smcap">Dot</span>,
<i>with a doll. Both wear sprigs of holly.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Everybody has given us such lovely presents. It
couldn't be nicer, could it, Dick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> [<i>sighing</i>]. I think it could be just a little nicer.
It would be nicer if we had a lot of brothers and sisters to help us
play with the soldiers and the blocks and the dolls and everything.
Oh, I wish&mdash;I wish that just for this one day I could have a whole
<i>roomful</i> of children to play with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> I'm afraid Jim and Polly aren't having as nice a
Christmas as ours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> [<i>shutting his knife</i>]. So am I. I don't think
Friendship Alley's a very nice place to have to live.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> I wish they could have a Christmas like ours. I'd like
to give them some things. Anyway, I'd like to show them our presents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> [<i>jumping up</i>]. Let's!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> When?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Now, right off. And, Dot, don't you know they said
they had never seen Santa Claus, either. It's 'most time for him to
come. Let's go and bring them over to see him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> All right. He'll give them something, too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">-85-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> We'll hide them so as to surprise everybody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> Will Papa and Mamma like it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Of course they will. Papa always likes our surprises,
and Mamma will, I know, because it would make her feel so sorry
if she knew there was anybody in the world that wasn't happy on
Christmas. She says that's the happiest day in the year, and
everybody ought to be happy. So we won't make her sorry by telling
her about it. We'll just make them happy too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dot.</span> We can have them take off their things in the nursery,
and then Jim can wash his face.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Exeunt. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Father</span>, <i>with paper which<br />
he throws on table.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> Well, the children seem to have grown tired of their
new things already. I don't see what has come over that boy lately.
He talks of nothing but big families. I suppose the sight of the
five little Blair children across the way is tantalizing, and it
certainly is lonely for the two little duds with nobody but grown-ups
in the house. Their efforts to be a large party in themselves, to
play games, on Thanksgiving day, were really laughable, but they
were pathetic, too. If Julia had thought of it, we might have had
a little Christmas party for them. It's a good deal of trouble for
Santa Claus to climb down a chimney for just two children. [<i>Looks
at his watch.</i>] The old gentleman ought to be here in about half an
hour. I wonder if it's too late to get some children now? Mr. Blair
might lend me his youngsters for an hour or so. It would be such a
nice surprise for the children. I could hide them somewhere, and at
a given signal have them come out. I'll just step across the way and
see.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Father</span>. <i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Aunt Jennie</span>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">-86-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt.</span> What a dreadful state the children have left this
room in. That blessed boy! I knew he couldn't wait to try his new
knife. His father would insist on giving it to him, though I'm sure
it's dangerous. Here are his chips all over the floor, and Dot has
had Dolly dressed and undressed a dozen times at least. [<i>Sits down
by fire, laughing indulgently.</i>] The way those children have been
talking the last few days is a puzzle! I can't think what started
them. I never had but one brother myself, and I'm sure I was quite
happy. What they want with ten brothers and sisters is beyond me.
A dozen children in the house would be more than their father and
Julia and I could stand, to say nothing of nurse and John. The two
alone can think of quite enough mischief to drive the household
crazy. I suppose our having so many friends when we were children
made a difference. We never used to be alone at Christmas. After all,
on holidays it would be forlorn. Too bad we didn't think of having
a party. There are so many children who would think it a treat to
come, too, who have no tree or Santa Claus at home. That little girl
of Ellen Lee's must be all alone to-day. [<i>Gets up decidedly.</i>] I
declare I'll just put on my hat and coat and go around there now and
get her. It'll be such a nice surprise for the children.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Exit in haste. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mother</span>. <i>Takes up<br />
doll, and sits down thoughtfully before the<br />
fire, rearranging doll's dress.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Dolly, you'd be surprised if you knew how badly
I'm feeling! I think I've been a very stupid, unrealizing sort of
a mother, not to plan something to make the children have a really
<i>merry</i> Christmas, as well as a happy one. It would have been so
easy to have a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">-87-</a></span> party of children here. Oh, Dolly, you know
all about it better than I do myself, for didn't I just hear Dot
confiding in you, and whispering in this little ear under your curls
how she wished you were a real live sister to play with her? Now you
see how I feel! Don't you see that if she had a hundred dolls, of wax
or china or rags, she would still have a stupid Christmas? I haven't
a doubt that you mean well, and you do fill a very large corner in
a little girl's heart&mdash;I haven't got over my fondness for your race
yet. [<i>Kisses the doll's curls.</i>] But you certainly are a trifle
obstinate about responding to friendly advances. Poor children, it's
so easy to give you pleasure! [<i>Lets doll fall in her lap.</i>] I might
have had a nice, jolly, little ... well, it's too late now. [<i>Sighs,
then looks at her watch.</i>] No! I don't believe it is, after all. I
still have time to go for little Jerry Gray and his sister. They are
just the ones! The children love surprises so. I'll hurry&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Exit in haste. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">John</span>.<br />
<i>While they talk together they put the room<br />
to rights.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Well, it do beat all, how thim children can make a
room look like so many pigs and chickens had been running through.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Thrue for you, an' it does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> An' what fer need they be wishin' there was tin of
thim to mess the house up worse?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> An' did they do that, thin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Sure they did. "Mary," says Dicky to me, "don't you
wish that I was five little b'ys and Dot was five little girls? We
do, we're so lonesome."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> An' that's what I heard them sayin' as I was
a-carryin' up coal this morning. "I wish I had a whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">-88-</a></span> room full of
brothers and sisters," says Dick. Faix! I wish I could give him some
of mine, then. I've enough to spare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> 'Tis sort of lonesome like, now, ain't it, John?
[<i>Hands on hips.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> [<i>hands on hips</i>]. Yes, it is that. I wonder&mdash;&mdash; Say,
Mary, me darlin', them three children of cook's sister's ain't going
to have much Christmas. Why can't you and me smuggle them up here
to the cupboard on the stairs, and when we comes up to help wid th'
tree, we'll just give the word and they'll pop out and say, Merry
Christmas. It'll be sort o' cheerful like, and Mistress is that
kind-hearted she ain't going to care.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> John, you have the brains of a elephant. I'll go right
down and fetch 'em now. [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> Poor children! They shall have some fun, that they
shall.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Re-enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mary</span> <i>with children.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Well, would you look at 'em, John? Cook she dressed
'em all up in green ribbons, bless their hearts. Says I, "Sure
to-day's not St. Patrick's day." "Well," says she, "what's fittin'
one holiday is fittin' the next. It's a good color anyhow. Them's
their best clothes." So I never touched 'em. I've told 'em about it,
John. Now, just go right up in here, children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John.</span> And when we say "Broomsticks!" out you bounces and
shouts, "Merry Christmas!" Now, Mary, we've redd up, we'll just go
below stairs. [<i>Exeunt.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span> Santa Claus, before you begin, I want to ask you a
question. Here are Jim and Polly, and they have always wanted to see
you, but you never went to their house, nor gave them any presents,
and they say they know some more poor people that you never go to
see. We thought you went everywhere and gave everybody presents! Why
didn't you ever give anything to Jim and Polly? We don't think that's
quite fair, Santa Claus!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> I know, and I think I can explain to you.

'Tis true, my child, I can't but say<br />
I have a very curious way<br />
Of bringing presents to girls and boys<br />
Who have least need of pretty toys,<br />
And giving books, and dolls, and rings,<br />
To those who already have such things.<br />
'Tis done for a very curious reason,<br />
Suggested by the Christmas season.<br />
Should I make my gifts to those who need,<br />
'Twould become a time of general greed,<br />
When all would think, "What shall we get?"<br />
"What shall we give?" they would quite forget.<br />
So when I send my gifts to-day,<br />
'Tis a hint "You have plenty to give away."<br />
And then I leave some poor ones out,<br />
That the richer may find, as they look about,<br />
Their opportunities close at hand,<br />
In every corner of the land.<br />
My token to those who in plenty live<br />
Is a gentle reminder, meaning,<br />

<h3>NOTES ON COSTUME AND SCENERY</h3>

<p>Ordinary costumes. Santa Claus (see note on costume, <a href="#Page_313">p. 313</a>) should
be taken by a man, but the other adult parts are for boys and
girls from fourteen to eighteen. Two or three older boys enact the
homeward-bound pedestrians who merely cross the stage in Act I, and
Father Browne and John, in coats and hats, may be among these.</p>

<p>The groups of children who come in at the end range from the very
smallest up to ten years.</p>

<p>If scenery is available, place grocery store in first scene, at the
back, and keep the children well in the center. In changing the
scene, time can be gained by setting the first scene in front of the
interior, as very little space is needed for the first act.</p>

<p>If scenery is not to be used, set grocery store less conspicuously
[<i>Right</i>], using screens and placing boxes and barrels before them.</p>

<h2>THE CHRISTMAS BROWNIE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span>: <i>Christmas Eve. The story begins at tea-time in the
nursery, and ends on Christmas morning, the night being bridged over
by</i> <span class="smcap">Ted's</span> <i>dream.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>Nursery, with fireplace,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> across corner [Right],
nursery pictures on the walls, and toys scattered about. The children
seated on little chairs around a low table [L.], having just finished
their tea</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ted</span> <i>at one end</i>, <span class="smcap">Kitty</span> <i>opposite
him</i>, <span class="smcap">Marjorie</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Rose</span> <i>on one side [facing
the audience], and</i> <span class="smcap">Robin</span> <i>with his chair half turned
away from the table. Curtain rises, showing the children singing a
Christmas song, while the nurse goes in and out with a tray, clearing
the table. The little girls sit with hands folded</i>, <span class="smcap">Kitty</span>
<i>sometimes helping the nurse, and the boys lounge comfortably in
their chairs. When the song is ended</i>, <span class="smcap">Ted</span> <i>leans his elbows
on the table.</i></p>

<p class="bp">Any Christmas song will do. "Oh, Ring, Glad Bells" (from <i>Songs and
Games for Little Ones</i><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>) is a very good one.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Oh, I do wish Papa and Mamma would get done their
supper and come up here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marjorie.</span> Seems to me it takes twice as long to eat supper
in the dining-room as it does up here in the nursery!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">-98-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted.</span> Grown folks are so slow about it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robin.</span> Guess they have more to eat, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse.</span> No, indeed, Master Robin, it's because they're polite
and don't eat so fast!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marjorie.</span> We do gobble just like Thanksgiving turkeys!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Rosy-posy never does. [<i>Patting little</i>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted.</span> Pooh! Rosebud doesn't eat more'n a bite, anyway!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose.</span> Maggie, please untie my bib.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted.</span> I'll do it for you. [<i>Jumps up and unties it. The

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Oh, I'm so excited! I don't believe I can sleep a
wink.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> [<i>shaking her finger</i>]. Santa Claus'll hear you 'way up
at the North Pole!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted.</span> I hope he's started on his travels before this, or he
won't get here for a week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robin.</span> Wouldn't you like to ride with him in his old sleigh,
though?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">-99-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted.</span> And help him fill the stockings!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marjorie.</span> I don't think I'd like going down chimneys much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> What a good chimney-sweep Santa Claus must make.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span> [<i>going to look up chimney</i>]. Oh, isn't it 'most time
to hang up the stockings? [<i>Comes to stand beside</i> <span class="smcap">Marjorie</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Maggie has gone to get them, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose.</span> But, Sister, how will Santa Claus know which is which?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> He'll know yours the minute he sees it, Pet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose.</span> Will he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted.</span> Sure!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robin.</span> Oh, I say, Ted, wouldn't it be a joke if he got 'em
all mixed up, and put my things in Marjorie's stocking, and yours in
Kitty's!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> He won't. He's such a wise old fellow that he always
knows, somehow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marjorie.</span> Well, I should think it would be lots easier if we
marked them! It must be dreadfully hard for him to remember.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted.</span> I'll tell you what! S'posing we write a list of the
things we want him to bring, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robin.</span> Good for you, Ted. Then he won't have to remember all
the letters we've been writing him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marjorie.</span> Give us some paper, quick, Kitty!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span> [<i>gets paper and pencils from mantel</i>, <span class="smcap">Ted</span>

the children in the world write him every year, shouldn't you think
his head must ache? [<i>Divides paper among children. All sit at table

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">-100-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Kitty</span>]. Will Santa Claus mind if I print

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> No, indeed. He likes printing.</p>

[<i>All write busily for a few moments.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robin.</span> I'm done. Look at that! [<i>Holds it up.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> My! what a long list!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose.</span> Oh-h-h! Santa Claus'll think you're greedy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robin.</span> I don't expect him to give me all those things.
That's just so he can choose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Here come Papa and Mamma. Now, Ted, go get the
stockings.</p>

<p class="right">

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Mamma, we've made lists&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> And we're going to pin them on our stockings&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marjorie.</span> Because we thought we ought to save poor Santa
Claus all the trouble we could.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> What thoughtful children! I'm sure Santa Claus will
appreciate it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robin.</span> Now, sit down and write your lists, quick!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. Santa Claus will be frightened by such
an array of wants. [<span class="smcap">Father</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mother</span> <i>sit down

<p><span class="smcap">Father.</span> Do you think his pack will hold out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span> [<i>with scorn</i>]. 'Course it will! That pack hasn't any
bottom at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Father</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. Oh, I see. Very well. But it's lucky

<p><span class="smcap">Ted</span> [<i>softly</i>]. I just can't go to bed yet. Robin went to
sleep the very minute he got into bed. Don't see how he could. Maggie
thinks I'm all nicely tucked in, and she's gone downstairs. [<i>Goes
to fireplace and looks up chimney.</i>] I do wish I could catch Santa
Claus. No signs of him yet, and I don't hear the sleigh-bells. I
think I'll just sit down and wait. [<i>Crosses to his own chair, and
sits facing audience, with one elbow on table.</i>] I believe I could

head out of fireplace, and then shows himself entirely, gradually
creeping nearer and nearer</i> <span class="smcap">Ted</span>, <i>as if irresistibly drawn
by his remarks.</i>] He does give people pretty much what they ask for,
but [<i>slowly</i>] if he just stopped a minute to think about it, he'd
find out what silly things they do think they want, sometimes. But
[<i>sighs</i>] he's getting so old that he doesn't find it out at all.
[<span class="smcap">Brownie</span>, <i>behind him, raises his hands in horror, then

thing for Santa Claus to choose one person in each family to help him
out,&mdash;with the planning, anyway, if he doesn't like to have anyone
else fill the stockings. S'posing he chose me! I could help him a
lot! [<span class="smcap">Brownie</span> <i>springs excitedly on the table, and bends

<p><span class="smcap">Ted</span> [<i>jumps up, and stands off a little way</i>]. Wow!
Wha&mdash;wha&mdash;&mdash; Who are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie</span> [<i>folds his arms and looks contemptuously down on</i>
<span class="smcap">Ted</span>]. <i>Who</i> is this impertinent snip of a boy who dares to
insinuate that my master, Santa Claus, is too old and decrepit to do
his work any longer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted.</span> Indeed, indeed, I didn't say that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie</span> [<i>wrathfully</i>]. What did you say, then? It sounded
very much like it. [<i>Shakes his head fiercely.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted.</span> I&mdash;I&mdash;I just said&mdash;that I think he makes mistakes
sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie</span> [<i>sitting down cross-legged on the table</i>]. Very
well, we'll just have this matter settled at once. Sit down, now,
and let me hear what you have to say. [<span class="smcap">Ted</span> <i>backs away from
his chair.</i>] No, that won't do. Sit down, I tell you. [<span class="smcap">Ted</span>
<i>reluctantly obeys, pulling his chair to a safe distance, and

complaints you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">-104-</a></span> have to register against your last year's stocking?
Wasn't everything in it that you asked for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted</span> [<i>anxious to appease</i>]. Oh, yes! and more, too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie.</span> And wasn't everything in it in perfect order? Was
anything broken?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted</span> [<i>emphatically</i>]. No! Everything was just out of sight!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie.</span> And weren't all the cracks stuffed tight with candy
and nuts and raisins?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted.</span> I should say they were!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie.</span> Then I'd like to know the meaning of this
discontent! You twentieth-century boys are a set of ungrateful
young scamps, who get the best of everything, and then complain of
it, and break it up in three days' time. Santa Claus is spoiling
you, <i>I</i> say! Boys a hundred years ago were thankful for the slates
and schoolbooks we gave them, and the girls were happy enough over
corncob dolls. Now you must have steam-engines, and motors, and
automobiles, and dolls that walk and talk, and are so full of cogs
and wheels that no real flesh-and-blood little girl could love them
at all. I tell you, in all my thousand years of existence, I have
never met anything so grasping as the modern children! [<i>Talks so
loud and gesticulates so wildly that</i> <span class="smcap">Ted</span> <i>backs away
again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted</span> [<i>meekly</i>]. Please, Mr.&mdash;Mr. Brownie, I didn't mean
that! Honest Injun, I didn't!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie.</span> Well, then, explain yourself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted.</span> I&mdash;I&mdash;I was just thinking that people ask Santa Claus
for such f-foolish things that it's a wonder he gives them anything
at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie.</span> Foolish! I should think they were!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted.</span> And if there was anybody that could tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">-105-</a></span> Santa Claus
about it, it would save him a lot of trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie.</span> And you think you could manage things better, do
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted.</span> I didn't say that,&mdash;I said I would like to help.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie</span> [<i>scratches his nose, scowling very hard</i>]. See
here. Suppose I let you try. Santa Claus is unusually busy to-night,
and is sending a great number of his Brownies out to fill stockings.
I was to look out for this house, among several hundred others, and
I&mdash;a&mdash;well, I have a fancy that I should enjoy letting you help.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted.</span> Oh, <i>will</i> you, really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie</span> [<i>jumping off table</i>]. Yes, I have about made up my
mind to let you into the secrets of the business. You can learn a few
things, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted.</span> Good for you! Thank you, ever so much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie.</span> Never mind. Wait till to-morrow before you thank
me. [<i>Grins meaningly.</i>] Now, let's be quick about this&mdash;the time is
getting short. We'll just go over these lists together, and you can
tell me what improvements to make. [<i>They go to the first stocking.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted.</span> Shall I get you a paper to write things down, so you
won't forget?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie</span> [<i>shouts angrily</i>]. Forget!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted.</span> Yes, I thought maybe since you're so old&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie.</span> That shows all you know about it! Of course there's
some excuse for <i>your</i> forgetting, since your memory is only ten
years long, but <i>mine's</i> a thousand years long, and I never forget
anything! Come, read me this list.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted</span> [<i>reading</i>]. "Encyclopedia Britannica." Now Papa can't
possibly want that, because he knows all about everything already.
And besides, I heard Mamma say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">-106-</a></span> she hadn't a bit of room for any
more books. "New knife." He did say his old one was dull, but it's
altogether too sharp for Robin and me to use, and that's sharp enough
for anybody! "New pocketbook." Why, he said the other day he hadn't
any money to put into it, so I don't see what good that'll do him.
"Key ring." If he has that, he'll put <i>all</i> the keys on it, and there
won't be any for Robin and me to drop lead through. [<i>Turns to the</i>
<span class="smcap">Brownie</span>.] So, you see, there isn't a thing that he really
wants on that list.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie.</span> Oh, certainly not!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted.</span> Now, Mamma's. "Half a dozen new bibs." Bibs! They don't
belong on her list. She can't have that! "Little rocking-chair." Now,
if she has a <i>little</i> rocking-chair, there won't be any room for us
on the arms of it,&mdash;that wouldn't do at all. "A rose vase." All her
vases are broken now, and if she had another, Maggie'd just smash it,
too, so what's the use in giving it to her? [<i>Turns to list.</i>] What's
all this at the bottom? "Most of all, five <i>good</i> boys and girls to
live with till next Christmas"! Jiminy Christopher, how <i>can</i> she
want five more?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie</span> [<i>significantly</i>]. She didn't say "<i>more</i>."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted</span> [<i>claps his hand over his mouth</i>]. Oh!... P'r'aps she
didn't mean that! P'r'aps she meant <i>us</i>! [<i>Stares thoughtfully
before him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie.</span> Hurry up! Look at this one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted.</span> That's Kitty's. Let's see. "A boy doll and a girl
doll." Now, don't you think Kitty's altogether too big for dolls? I
suppose <i>little</i> girls must have dolls, but they're terribly silly
things. "Half a Dozen Girls." That's nothing but an old girl's book.
Give her stories about fights and Indians and bears to read to us.
"Pa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">-107-</a></span>per dolls." There it is again. "Napkin ring." Now, that's the
only sensible thing she's got down.... This one's mine. I won't stop
to read that, because I only put down the things I've <i>got</i> to have.
Let's see if I can read Robin's. [<i>Puzzles over it.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie</span> [<i>reading</i> <span class="smcap">Ted's</span> <i>list</i>]. "Boxing-gloves.
Baseball. Roller-coaster. Skates. Boots. Marbles."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted.</span> Oh, now I see what it is. "Rubber boots." He doesn't
need those. I'm going to have some new ones, and my others aren't
much too big for him. "Marbles." He's got more marbles now 'n' any
boy I know. "Top. Kite"&mdash;this isn't the time of year for those
things. Never mind, I'll tell you what he wants in a minute. Now,
Margie. "Dolls" again. She's got three dozen if she's got one!
"Music-box." Pshaw! they just go and smash right away. "Paints."
She'd paint up all the chairs and tables in the house and nobody
would like it a bit. "Little stove"&mdash;that might be nice,&mdash;but I'm
afraid she'd burn herself. You see, <i>she</i> hasn't got anything good
on her list, either. Now, Rose comes last of all. [<i>Looks at</i>
<span class="smcap">Rose's</span> <i>list a moment.</i>] Well, I guess Rosebud ought to
have everything she's asked for. [<i>Turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Brownie</span>, <i>and
the two walk away from the fire.</i>] Now, didn't I tell you how it
was? People want such silly things! Now, I'll tell you what to bring
instead. [<i>Puts his arm across</i> <span class="smcap">Brownie's</span> <i>shoulder, and
whispers in his ear, pointing to one stocking after another.</i>] ...
Now, I guess that's all. It was awfully good of you to let me help,
and I know they'll all be pleased. [<i>Walks around table, sits with
his back to audience. Stretches his arms above his head, and yawns
aloud.</i>] I really believe I could go to sleep now. [<i>Drops his head
on his hands.</i> <span class="smcap">Brownie</span> <i>waves his wand above</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">-108-</a></span> <span class="smcap">Ted</span>,
<i>who gradually sinks down, head on arms, fast asleep.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie.</span> Now I guess he's in for a good night's sleep.
Little scamp! He ought to have some kind of a trick played on him,
but Santa Claus forbids any pranks on Christmas Eve. [<i>Crosses to
fireplace.</i>] What <i>shall</i> I do about these stockings, anyway? These
poor children are going to be dreadfully disappointed to-morrow
if I keep my promise to that scallywag, Ted. Perhaps I'd better
telephone Santa Claus about it. [<i>Takes up the toe of a stocking
and speaks through it, moving it from mouth to ear as he speaks or
listens.</i>] Hello! Hello, there! North Pole! Please connect me with
Santa Claus.... Hello, is that you, Santa? I want to consult you
about some doubtful business.... Yes, sir, Mr. Bird's house.... His
boy is making a dreadful mess with these stockings.... He wants them
all filled with presents for himself.... What's that you say? Let
him try it?... Be a good lesson for him?... All right, sir! Thank
you. Any trouble with icebergs? No?... That's good.... All right,
good-by! [<i>Drops stocking.</i>] Well, I must see it through, then, I
suppose. [<i>Takes down the stockings and carries them into the chimney
two at a time. When the last is carried out, he brings them back in
the same order, filled. To avoid delay, a double set is prepared,
the</i> <span class="smcap">Brownie</span> <i>leaving the empty ones and bringing the full
ones instead.</i>] Well, he's pretty generous to himself, anyway. And he
thinks it's all for their good! [<i>Walks over and stands looking at</i>
<span class="smcap">Ted</span>.] I'll just say good-night to you, now, young man....
No! before I go, I believe I'll give you a few Christmas dreams.

at all, Santa Claus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Well, my dear, you will when I tell you about
it. You see, I had a new helper, last night, and it wasn't to be

badly, indeed,&mdash;&mdash; [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Ted</span>] didn't he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ted.</span> He never felt worse in his life!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> So he came to me and begged me to fix the
matter for him, and I've agreed to do it. He never suspected that I
knew about it before he told me, but I did know, all the time, and
so I've come prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">-116-</a></span> to make it up to you for all the trouble Ted
caused&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> <i>Ted!</i></p>

<h3>NOTES ON COSTUME, SETTING, AND PRESENTATION</h3>

<p>For the parents, nurse, and children, ordinary costumes. Adult parts
taken by older girls and boy. Ages of children as indicated in cast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brownie.</span> Wears a close-fitting suit of dark brown canton
flannel, with trimmings of lighter brown or tan&mdash;a small collar,
cuffs, and a belt with long points. The shoes are long, with points
turned up at the toes, and the cap, close-fitting, hides the hair
and covers the neck at the back, but allows the ears to show. It is
finished with a point (stuffed and wired to keep it upright) which
comes from the back and curves above the head.</p>

<p>All the Brownie's actions and motions should be startlingly sudden
and swift. He should alternate between absolute stillness, and a
quickness like a wild bird's.</p>

<p>A great deal of humor can be put into the scene of disappointment
over the stockings, especially by the older girls and boy who play
the adult parts.</p>

<p>Prepare a double set of stockings, one empty, the other filled; the
Brownie carries out the empty ones, and returns with the full ones.
As these are not examined on the stage, they may be stuffed with
anything that is most convenient. Have in readiness a row of small
hooks on the mantel, for hanging them.</p>

<p>For <span class="smcap">Santa Claus'</span> costume, see note, <a href="#Page_313">p. 313</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">-118-</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Costumes in the &#8220;Dream&#8221;</span></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Horner.</span> May be dressed, if desired, in Kate Greenaway
style, but ordinary costume is all that is required. Jack recites the
nursery rhyme, at the end pulling a large plum out of a brown paper
pie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Santa Claus.</span> A plump little girl in a long dark dress,
white apron and kerchief, big white cap with wide frill, and large
spectacles on her nose. One hand holds the corner of her apron full
of toys, the other is stretched out as if dispensing gifts to the
children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Young Santa Claus.</span> Little boy in boots, thick coat, toboggan
cap and mittens, well covered with white cotton snow, and sprinkled
at the last moment with diamond dust. He stands with one hand on a
tall red chimney, the other just lifting his heavy pack of toys.
Make chimney by covering a long dry-goods box with red, and painting
bricks with ordinary black ink. Set on stage for this tableau.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas." Little boy, daintily dressed, his arms full of
toys, with a drum, a horse, etc., piled at his feet.</p>

<p>"No Christmas." A very ragged boy and girl. The boy stands with his
left arm around his little sister, his right hand holding hers. The
child looks up into his face confidingly.</p>

<p>The Christmas Waits. Four boys and four girls between six and
twelve years of age. These children may be elaborately dressed,
after Seventeenth Century pictures, or very simply&mdash;the girls in
white kerchiefs and caps, the boys in short capes of any dull black
material, with steeple hats, made of cardboard covered with black.
These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">-119-</a></span> children should have good voices for the carol, "Noël! Noël!
the Christ is born!"<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> March as described in text.</p>

<p>These tableaux are arranged on a small stage or platform behind scene
at back, upon which the light is concentrated, the main stage being
darkened. Properties should be in readiness, and the children must be
taught to take their poses quickly and without noise.</p>

<p>For this small stage or platform a kindergarten table serves
excellently, covered with dark green, a step being placed for the
use of the Waits in their march. If practicable, a curtain made
to match the scene, and rise for the tableaux, may be used, but
plain curtains, hung like portières, and parting in the center, are
also effective. Attention should not in any way be drawn to this
curtain, in order that the first tableau may come as a surprise to
the audience. The point of chief importance is that, whatever the
arrangement of the curtain, it should work silently and without
hitch.</p>

<h2>A PURITAN CHRISTMAS</h2>

<h3>ACT I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span>: <i>Evening of December 18th.</i></p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>Kitchen in</i> <span class="smcap">Mistress Goodspeede's</span> <i>cottage,

beside it supposed to lead to loft. Back R., door; L., window,
opening upon a desolate winter scene. L., door, leading to another
chamber. Down L., a spinning-wheel. Furniture, a few plain chairs
and stools, and a settle. By the window a table where little</i>
<span class="smcap">Prudence</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Patience</span> <i>are washing the supper
dishes.</i> <span class="smcap">Patience</span> <i>stands upon a stool in order to reach the
dishpan more easily</i>, <span class="smcap">Prudence</span> <i>wipes the dishes and lays
them on the table.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Patience</span> [<i>severely</i>]. Prudence, if thee's not very careful,
I know thee'll drop the platter!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prudence.</span> Oh, no! Patience, I'm being very careful. I
wouldn't let it drop for anything. It's Mother's very best platter,
too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patience.</span> And if thee broke it, who knows if dear Mother
could ever get a new one? She hath told me many a time she brought it
with her from Old England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">-124-</a></span> and she saith the like cannot be found
here&mdash;even in Boston town.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prudence</span> [<i>gives it an admiring look, then lays it
cautiously on the table</i>]. I'm sure it's the most beautiful platter
that ever was seen. Are there many more dishes, Patience, dear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patience</span> [<i>in a motherly tone</i>]. No. Poor little maid, I
fear me thou'rt very weary. Here&mdash;just these cups, and I'll help
thee. [<i>Gets down from stool and helps to wipe one or two cups.</i>]
Where are the boys, I wonder? You and I, Prudence, can never, never
reach to put the dishes away on the shelf.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prudence.</span> No, but brother Roger or Myles can do it. Mother
says they grow like tall weeds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patience.</span> And the parson says they are brave striplings.
[<i>Sighs.</i>] I would I were tall and strong. Then I should never be
afraid of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prudence</span> [<i>looks fearfully over her shoulder</i>]. Afraid of
<i>what</i>, Patience?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patience</span> [<i>putting her arm around</i> <span class="smcap">Prudence</span>]. Oh,
never mind, Prudence, dear, not afraid of, of&mdash;<i>anything</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prudence</span> [<i>pushes her back and shakes her finger</i>], I know,
Patience, thee was going to say&mdash;Indians! Oh, Patience, doesn't thee
wish Mother'd come home? [<i>Lays her head on</i> <span class="smcap">Patience's</span>
<i>shoulder.</i> <span class="smcap">Myles</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Nathan</span> <i>pass the window.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patience.</span> Never mind, sister, here come Myles and Nathan.
[<i>Enter the boys.</i>] Myles, has thee seen Roger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nathan.</span> Roger has gone to fetch our Mother home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prudence</span> [<i>going to table</i>]. Oh, Myles, won't thee please
put the dishes up for us? Patience and I are far too little.
[<span class="smcap">Nathan</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Prudence</span> <i>carry dishes one at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">-125-</a></span> a time

<p><span class="smcap">Myles.</span> Where is Mother, Patience?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patience.</span> Mistress Submit Wells hath a fever, and after
supper Mother went to see if there was aught she could do to help.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nathan</span> [<i>looking out of the window</i>]. I see Mother and Roger
coming up the hill now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patience.</span> Quick, Nathan! Empty the pan for us!
[<span class="smcap">Patience</span> <i>opens the door for</i> <span class="smcap">Nathan</span>, <i>who carries

<span class="smcap">Roger</span>, <i>hanging up his hat, goes to fire.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patience.</span> How did thee find Mistress Wells, Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Much better to-night, daughter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prudence</span> [<i>catching at her skirts</i>]. Thou'lt not go back,
then, Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> No, little Prudence, not to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> It's fearsome cold out. Do stir the fire, Myles.
[<i>Warms his hands, while</i> <span class="smcap">Myles</span> <i>stirs fire.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nathan.</span> Then come sit down with us by the fire, Mother. Thee
surely won't work any more to-night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> I am willing, Nathan, but I must be knit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">-126-</a></span>ting. With
three great lads who wear out so many stockings, I am kept more than
busy, even if the good parson did not exhort us never to be idle.
[<i>Exit and re-enter with knitting.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patience</span> [<i>drawing up her</i> <span class="smcap">Mother's</span> <i>chair and
arranging stools</i>]. Here, Mother, here's thy big chair. Prudence and
I will get our stools. Oh, Roger, do get out of the way! Make haste!
Thee's such a giant thee'll block the firelight out entirely.</p>

<span class="smcap">Nathan</span> <i>lies at full length before the
fire.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger</span> [<i>good-humoredly</i>]. What a pity thee didn't name that
child <i>Im</i>patience, Mother. It would become her so much better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> [<i>while</i> <span class="smcap">Patience</span> <i>bends her face low over
her knitting</i>]. Does thee think it would make it any easier for her
to be good, Roger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Well, I'm glad thou gavest us good sober English
names. I'm sure 'twould never help me to be good if I had been named
Hate-Evil, like Elder Hopkins' son. Think of it&mdash;Hate-Evil Hopkins!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myles.</span> And if Father had called me Love-the-Truth or
Have-Courage, instead of naming me after our fine Captain Standish, I
know I never would have tried half so hard to be brave and truthful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> <i>That</i> was what Father cared for, Myles, whatever
thy name might have been.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> One of us is fitly named, at any rate, Mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">-127-</a></span> and
that is thyself, Mistress Delight Goodspeede! [<i>Bows.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patience.</span> Yes, Mother <i>is</i> our Delight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myles.</span> And everybody's else, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. Take care, children, you will make me
vain, and then the parson will preach a whole sermon about vanity,
and call out in the midst of it, "Delight Goodspeede, stand forth!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> How terrible! [<i>All laugh.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nathan.</span> He calleth vanity a light and shallow thing, but
I'll warrant me he would turn his hour-glass at the least four times
while he discoursed upon it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myles.</span> More terrible still!</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>All laugh again. A knock at the door.</i><br />

<p><span class="smcap">Indian.</span> Eaglefeather not tell. Eaglefeather show, to-morrow.
Tired now. March long, long time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger</span> [<i>watching her</i>]. I know what Mother is thinking of!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Tell us, then, Roger, if thou be a wizard.</p>

thou'st guessed aright!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myles</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Nathan</span>. Tell us about the Yule-tide,
Mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prudence.</span> Is <i>this</i> the Christmas day, Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> No, Prudence. It's the twenty-fifth that is
Christmas. Isn't it, Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myles.</span> Just a week from to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Yes, children, just a week from to-day it will be
Christmas in Old England.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patience.</span> But why did Mistress Wells make thee think of
Christmas?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> 'Twas what Myles said about Mistress Wells and
Eaglefeather here. 'Twas because Christmas in my father's home in Old
England was the time of all others when people did kind and friendly
deeds, when poor folks came to the houses of rich men without fear of
being driven away, and our homes were open to all who needed food and
warmth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prudence</span> [<i>wonderingly</i>]. Why, then, Mother, I think it must
have been like heaven!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nathan.</span> Mother, doesn't thee sometimes wish we were all back
in England once more?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> [<i>earnestly</i>]. Never wish that, my son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myles.</span> Not after all the bitter cold winters and hardships
here, Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> 'Tis the very hardships we have endured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">-130-</a></span> that will
build up a new and better England for us here, Myles&mdash;&mdash; But the Old
Christmas was a happy time.</p>

<p class="right">
[<span class="smcap">Eaglefeather</span>, <i>who has been sleeping, sits<br />
up, and from this point listens intently.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Won't thee tell us more about it, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> I've told thee many times already, Roger, how the
great Yule-log was brought in and lighted on Christmas Eve&mdash;such a
monster log that it would burn until Twelfth Night. We always saved
a bit of it, then, to light the next year's log. The old folks said
that was for luck. All the young folks went out into the forest to
gather the Christmas greens, holly, mistletoe, and long festoons of
ground pine for wreaths. Ah, it was merry work, and the great hall
in my father's house was a brave sight when we had decked it in the
green. And on Christmas day we had our Christmas bough covered with
shining candles and bright gifts for each other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prudence.</span> How beautiful, Mother!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> And we were awakened at dawning by the poor children
of the village singing their joyous carols beneath our windows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myles.</span> How I wish I could hear them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> The singing in our meeting on the Sabbath isn't very

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> [<i>rising</i>]. Roger and Myles, silence! I will not have
this wicked mocking of our good elders. Haven't you heard the parson
tell the story of how the bears ate the children who mocked Elisha?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> Forgive us, Mother, we meant no disrespect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myles.</span> But, verily, the sound of the singing maketh me
almost as sad as the sight of the bears could.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nathan.</span> But, Mother, why do the good fathers never allow us
to have a Christmas?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> There can be no wrong in the things thou'st told us.
Peace and good will and neighborliness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> But that was not all, Roger. With the feasting and
merriment came much that the good Puritan Fathers did well to abolish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prudence</span> [<i>stands at</i> <span class="smcap">Mother's</span> <i>knee</i>]. But,
Mother, isn't a birthday always a happy day? [<span class="smcap">Mother</span> <i>nods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">-132-</a></span>
and smiles.</i>] Then I should think the Lord Christ's birthday would be
the very happiest day of all, and the good parson would like to have
us sing and be joyful and glad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> [<i>kisses her</i>]. Thou'rt too little to understand it
yet, my Prudence. [<i>Rises.</i>] Come, we have sat too long with our
talking. If our candles are not soon out, the tithing-man will be
tapping at our door and reproving us. [<i>Leads the two little girls
and</i> <span class="smcap">Nathan</span> <i>to door (L.)</i>]. Come, children. Myles, see that
the fire is safe. Roger, is the door fast? [<span class="smcap">Myles</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Roger</span> <i>attend to the fire and the door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indian.</span> Must Eaglefeather go now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Does thee think, lad, that savage though thou art,
I would drive thee out into the bitter night? No, there is too much
Yule-tide in our hearts for that! I have no bed for thee, but lay
thee down by the fire and welcome. [<i>Begins to wind the clock.</i>]
Boys, bring in some straw for a bed&mdash;&mdash; Stay a moment. Straw will not
do. A chance spark from the fire might light it, and burn the house
above our heads. There is an old mat in the shed without. See if you
can find it.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> [<i>musingly</i>]. I told little Prudence she was too
young to understand, yet with my years, am I quite sure that I
understand it myself? No, the good Fathers can never crush and kill
the loving Christmas spirit. [<i>Enter boys, quietly arranging mat,

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> Of a truth I do mean it, Roger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> But, Mother, they will persecute thee&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myles.</span> And drive us all into the wilderness&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> And with Father away on his ship, who could take care
of thee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> I have come into one wilderness before, Myles. I am
not afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> But how can we do it, Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> I will go up to Boston town to-morrow&mdash;I can easily
walk there and back again before 'tis dusk&mdash;and buy what little
things I may for gifts. I hear that a ship has but now come into port.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myles.</span> Doesn't thee wish it was Father's vessel, Roger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> <i>Then</i> wouldn't we have a Christmas!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> 'Twill be many a weary month before Father's ship
returns, I fear. But whatever this bark may be, she hath surely
brought some small trinkets that will do for us. I'll find them and
bring them home with me. Then on the day before Christmas thou and
Myles must go into the woods and cut a small evergreen, as perfect a
one as you can find. At dark on Christmas Eve you can bring it home,
and when the children are in bed we will dress it. Then, early on
Christmas dawn, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">-134-</a></span> the neighbors are stirring, we will light it

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> But, Mother, they will surely find us out!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myles.</span> That Reuben Turner is always spying upon us. And so
is Gershom Porter. [<i>Boys at window dodge below the sill.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> And, Mother, they think thou art only half a Puritan
now, because thou canst sometimes smile and art not always stern and
sour like the rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myles.</span> And they say thou art vain and frivolous because thou
keep'st brazen fire-dogs and candlesticks instead of iron ones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roger.</span> And dost not dress thy daughters in solemn black.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. Do they say so? What a list of sins!
[<i>Seriously.</i>] With thee and Myles to help me I am not afraid.
We will have our Christmas bough&mdash;no, not a bough, but a whole
<i>tree</i>&mdash;if we needs must light it at midnight and cover the window
with blankets! Now get quickly to bed in the loft. 'Tis shocking late!</p>

about Tree. Say this Christmas Day. Good Day. Nobody hurt nobody.
Bald Eagle listen. Say tell braves. Not let braves burn village. Now,
now! Not hurt kind squaw! [<i>Folds his arms proudly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gilbert Appleton</span> [<i>coming forward</i>]. Every word the lad says
is true, sir!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> Gilbert Appleton! What does he mean! How does thee know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gilbert.</span> Because I was there. Good friends and neighbors,
you all know that I, Gilbert Appleton, have been much among the
savages. I know their speech, and their ways. Bald Eagle's tribe have
always seemed friendly, but two days ago, when I was hunting with my
match-lock near their camp, they made a prisoner of me and kept me
there until just now. What Eaglefeather here hath told you is true.
They would have burned the village if he had not begged the chief
for the sake of Mistress Delight's great kindness to spare it. Good
neighbors, 'tis my belief that this little Christmas tree hath saved
us all! [<i>During his story all hang upon his words, drawing close and
shuddering at the thought of a massacre, and sighing with relief at
the end.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All.</span> Strange! Wonderful! Did'st ever hear the like!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gilbert.</span> And, furthermore, the savages, who meant to make me
guide them by the quickest way into our village, were moved to set me
free at midnight and I have but now made my way back to you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turner.</span> Unheard-of forbearance!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dominie Cobb.</span> Can we credit our ears!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Wells.</span> 'Tis like a miracle!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Delight.</span> 'Tis not so strange, either. We do not,
we cannot know how much power even a very little good will and
friendliness may have. I but thought to make my children happy, and
because I loved my dear home in Old England I told them of customs
there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prudence.</span> Mother, I would like to tell the good Elder
something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patience</span> [<i>aside</i>]. He will only say thou art a forward
wench, Prudence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prudence.</span> Will he, Mother? Will he frown and say, "Children
should be seen and not heard"?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elder Hopkins.</span> Nay, my little maid. I will listen gladly.</p>

<p class="right">
[<span class="smcap">Prudence</span> <i>goes to him and puts her hands

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prudence</span> [<i>earnestly</i>]. We didn't think it could be wrong,
good Elder. Mother said it was the Lord's birthday, and we couldn't
help being glad about that, could we? And Mother taught us a song
about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Elder Hopkins.</span> Then will you sing it for us, little maids?</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Porter.</span> Good friends, these little maids and their
song do touch my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turner.</span> Truly, when we sought to bring truth and
righteousness to the new land, I fear we were forgetting charity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jared.</span> Was Christmas like this in Old England?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane.</span> My Mother would never tell me of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Priscilla.</span> I would it were so here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patience.</span> Mother made the tree for us, but we'd like to give
you all something from it. May we, Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother.</span> We will gladly share it if the good Elder will
forgive any harm we may have done.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deacon Porter.</span> There was much that was good in the old ways,

<p><span class="smcap">Elder Hopkins.</span> I will take a sprig in memory of the happy
Christmases in Old England.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Wells.</span> Perhaps we may e'en keep what was good in
the old ways here in this New England. I'll take a bit of green, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All the others.</span> And I, too. And I!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Delight.</span> For the sake of the happy Christmases of
old, and the homes we left, and more than all for the sake of the
very first Christmas Day of all, let us sing one of the dear old
carols we have loved so long.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON COSTUME AND STAGING</h3>

<p>Grown people, whose parts are taken by boys and girls from seventeen
to twenty, and children, are dressed alike&mdash;men and boys in
knee-trousers, coats with square white collars and cuffs, large belt-
and shoe-buckles, broad-brimmed felt hats, with crowns high and flat.
If the costumes are to be fully carried out, all should wear wigs,
cropped round. Or they may be worn by the Elders only.</p>

<p>Women and girls wear plain dark-colored dresses, with rather full
skirts, the children's as long as their mothers'. White kerchiefs,
capes, and hoods, of dark colors with bright scarlet or gray-blue
linings. The hoods are large and loose, with the edge turned back,
giving color about the face. Mistress Delight, Patience, and Prudence
wear white caps instead of the hoods.</p>

<p>Pictures of Puritan costumes are easily found in the Perry or Brown
collections.</p>

<p>These costumes are best made of canton or outing flannel. Buckles can
be made of cardboard and covered with silver paper, or cut from tin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Indian.</span> Suit made of tan canton flannel, fringed at edge of
coat, sleeves, and trousers, with a band of fringe up and down arms
and legs. He wears moccasins, beads, and a feather head-dress on
his black wig. He carries bow and arrows, and a wooden tomahawk. A
quiver can be made of a good-sized mailing-tube. He must have Indian
make-up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">-146-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hunter&#8217;s</span> dress is more like the Indian's than like the
colonist's, but he does not wear his hair long, and his suit should
be trimmed with furs, not fringe. Fur cap with tail hanging down at
back. He carries an old gun, not a bow.</p>

<p>Mistress Delight's children range from Roger, twelve years old, down
to little Prudence, five. The Indian is a boy of Roger's age. The
hunter, sixteen or seventeen.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The little Christmas tree should be a very "homemade" one. Strings
of popcorn and cranberries, spools and balls covered with bright
paper, may be used for decorations, Indian baskets, and such toys
as the little Puritans might have made, or any little quaint and
old-fashioned trinkets to carry out this idea. Only white candles
should be used, and these fastened on in the simplest and most
unobtrusive manner.</p>

<p>The singing of the old psalm should be made as doleful and droning,
even nasal, as possible. It can be sung to the Scotch tune of
"Windsor," which is to be found in most hymn-books. The number of
verses used may be determined by the amusement and applause of the
audience. The boys who sing it must on no account allow themselves to
laugh.</p>

<p>The charm and picturesqueness of the stage will be greatly enhanced
if quaint old-time household articles can be borrowed or manufactured
for properties&mdash;bellows, lantern, candlesticks, andirons, an old
foot-stove&mdash;above all, a warming-pan, which the mother fills at the
fire and carries out when she takes the younger children to bed.
The dishes and platter so much admired by Patience should be rather
conspicuously ugly.</p>

<p>Finally, a word in regard to the old-time English.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">-147-</a></span> When the play
was first given it was feared that the children would find it a
stumbling-block, and that it would have to be dropped. Quite the
reverse proved to be the case, however, and the children all gave
their lines with delightful naturalness and evident enjoyment. This
has been equally true of other groups of children by whom the play
has since been given. They show no awkwardness in the use of the old
forms, but seem to feel that it carries them out of the everyday, and
makes danger and adventure real to them.</p>

<h2>THE CHRISTMAS MONKS</h2>

<h3>ACT I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span>: <i>The 10th of April.</i></p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>Country road leading by the Convent. R., an angle
of the Convent Wall. On it a large sign trimmed with evergreens,
"Wanted, by the Christmas Monks, two good boys to assist in garden
work. Applicants will be examined by</i> <span class="smcap">Fathers Anselmus</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>, <i>on April 8th, 9th, and 10th." Enter (R.)</i>
<span class="smcap">Mistress Longlane</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly</span>, <i>wearily, as if at
the end of a long journey.</i> <span class="smcap">Mistress Longlane</span> <i>carries a
large basket.</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly</span> <i>hangs back.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Longlane</span> [<i>rather crossly</i>]. Now, Dolly Longlane,
what with your stopping to gather flowers by the roadside, or to
watch the clouds, or to listen to the birds in the hedges, we'll
never reach our journey's end. Make haste, now!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dolly</span> [<i>tearfully</i>]. But, Mother, it's such a long, long
way, and I'm <i>so</i> tired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Longlane</span> [<i>relenting</i>]. So you are, poor lamb.
Well, a few moments can't make a very great difference, so sit ye
down on the basket and take a rest. [<i>Puts basket down (L.), and
seats</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly</span> <i>on it, wipes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">-152-</a></span> her own face, straightens her
bonnet, and then looks about her. Sees sign, at which she glances
indifferently, then with interest, at last with amazement. Reads
through, then takes out spectacles and reads again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Longlane.</span> Now, what may be the meaning of <i>this</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dolly.</span> What is it, Mother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Longlane</span> [<i>reads sign to</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly</span>]. The
Christmas Monks? What manner of men are the Christmas Monks? Here
comes some good dame from the village. I'll make bold to ask.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mistress Spinning</span>, <i>with little</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Peggy</span> <i>(L.).</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Longlane</span> [<i>courtesying</i>]. Good morrow, Mistress.
Have you a moment to spare for a stranger in the country?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Spinning</span> [<i>courtesying</i>]. Yes, indeed, Mistress,
and right gladly. Make your manners, Peggy.</p>

<p class="right">
[<span class="smcap">Peggy</span> <i>courtesies first to</i> <span class="smcap">Mistress Longlane</span><br />
<i>and then to</i> <span class="smcap">Dolly</span>, <i>who rises from<br />
the basket and courtesies, too.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Longlane.</span> Why, Mistress, I am minded to ask the
meaning of this strange sign that hangs upon the wall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Spinning.</span> Oh, you must indeed be a stranger in the
land if you have never heard of the Christmas Monks. If you have come
to make your home in our village, you'll soon learn, I'll warrant me,
that this is the home of the Christmas Monks who keep the gardens in
which all the Christmas toys are grown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Longlane.</span> The Christmas toys!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">-153-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dolly.</span> Why, I thought Santa Claus brought them all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Spinning.</span> So he does, my dear. He takes them to the
children, of course, but this is the garden where he comes to load
his sleigh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Longlane.</span> You don't say!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peggy</span> [<i>shaking her finger</i>]. You never can see inside, but
that garden is just full of toys. Oh, don't you wish we could peep
in! [<i>Both children run in search of holes or cracks, stretch their
arms towards the top, and stand on tiptoe, vainly, finally coming
back to listen to the conversation of their mothers.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Spinning.</span> Yes, the Christmas Monks have a wonderful
garden with beds for rocking-horses, beds for dolls, beds for drums,
and picture-books and skates and balls. They do say so, that is;
of course, I've never seen the inside. And the seeds are just the
tiniest bits of dolls and drums and balls, and the rest of it. So
little that you can hardly see them at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Longlane.</span> What do the Monks do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Spinning.</span> Why, they plant the seeds, and take care
of the garden, and see that the toys are all ripe and ready for good
old Santa Claus by Christmas time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peggy.</span> And that's not all, Mother. They have turkey and plum
pudding <i>every</i> day in the year! [<i>Hugs herself.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dolly.</span> Oh, my!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peggy.</span> And it says "Merry Christmas" over the gate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Spinning.</span> Yes, and every morning they file into
the chapel and sing a Christmas carol, and every evening they ring a
Christmas chime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">-154-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peggy.</span> And they have wax candles in all the windows every
night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Longlane.</span> Why, it's like Christmas every day in the
year!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dolly.</span> Aren't you glad we've come to live in this village,
Mother? [<i>Clasps her hands.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Longlane.</span> That I am, my dear. Why, it's enough to
make one laugh just to hear of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Spinning.</span> That it is, Mistress. You're quite right.
The Christmas Monks are so full of the Christmas spirit that it lasts
them all the year round, and they just go about putting heart into
them that get sad and discouraged. But I think I see some of the
children coming for the examination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Longlane.</span> Ah! Yes. That's to take place this
afternoon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Spinning.</span> Yes, this is the last afternoon of it.
The good Fathers have already held two examinations and, will you
believe it? [<i>Coming closer and speaking very impressively.</i>] They
haven't found two boys who are good enough yet, though they've
examined <i>hundreds</i>.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Annetta</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Marianna</span>, <i>talking together.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Annetta.</span> Oh, Marianna, don't you wonder whom the good
Fathers will choose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marianna.</span> Yes, indeed, I do, Annetta. Why, there aren't very
many more boys to examine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Annetta.</span> No, nearly all the boys in the kingdom have tried.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marianna.</span> But they're all naughty in some way or other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">-155-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Annetta.</span> Oh, don't you wish it was two <i>girls</i> the Fathers
wanted?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marianna.</span> Oh, don't I! Ssh! Here comes Peter with his little
sister Rosalia.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Peter</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Rosalia</span>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> Here are some flowers I picked for you, sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalia.</span> Thank you, Peter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> See, sister, that's the sign, and the Monks come
right here to examine the boys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalia.</span> Oh, Peter, I wish they'd take you to work in the
Christmas garden!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> There isn't much chance of that, I'm afraid. But,
come, sister, I'd better take you home. You might get hurt in the
crowd. [<i>Exit (L.)</i>, <span class="smcap">Peter</span> <i>bowing politely as he passes the
women.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Annetta.</span> Marianna, why wouldn't Peter try?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marianna.</span> He's going to try to-day, I believe. He wouldn't
before because he is so modest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Annetta.</span> But he's the very best boy in the village, and so
good to his parents and his little lame sister!</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Gilbert</span>, <span class="smcap">Robin</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Walter</span>; <i>all<br />
stand, hands in pockets, before the sign, and<br />
read it in silence.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gilbert.</span> I wish we had been examined yesterday. I hate not
to know about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robin.</span> Well, perhaps we'll have a better chance to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter.</span> Yes, there aren't so many of us to choose from.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gilbert.</span> I suppose the boys that get in there can have all
the tops and balls they want.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robin.</span> Every day in the year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter.</span> Why, all you'd have to do would be to pick them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Longlane</span> [<i>looking out L.</i>]. Why, what's this
coming down the road?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Spinning.</span> Why, mercy on us, 'tis the Prince. He
must be coming to try the examination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince</span> [<i>interrupting angrily</i>]. I say I will not be kept

<p><span class="smcap">Court Lady.</span> Oh, your Highness, condescend to have a little
patience!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince</span> [<i>more angrily</i>]. I will <i>not</i> have patience.
Patience is not a virtue for Kings and Princes. [<i>Taps his foot on

<p><span class="smcap">Anselm</span> [<i>rubbing his hands</i>]. Yes, Brother Gregory. I trust
we shall discover the right boys at last. Let me see. [<i>Looks about,

<h3>ACT II</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span>: <i>One week before Christmas.</i></p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>Inside the garden. At back, the wall. Against it
(R.), the Doll bed. Left, small trees with toys. Down Center and
across Front, garden paths.</i> <span class="smcap">Prince</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Peter</span>
<i>in Monks' robes and sandals.</i> <span class="smcap">Prince</span> <i>sitting idly on a
wheelbarrow.</i> <span class="smcap">Peter</span> <i>working with rake in the Doll bed.
Tools, watering can, etc., scattered about.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Prince</span> [<i>crossly</i>]. Well, I don't see how you can <i>stand</i>
this place, Peter. I've had more than enough&mdash;I'm just sick of it, I
am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span> [<i>still working</i>], I'm sorry, your Highness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince.</span> Yes, that's what you always say. I wish you would
stop that everlasting work and come here and tell me why you're
sorry? Why in the world do you keep on working and working? I believe
you like it. Come here, I tell you!</p>

<p class="right">
[<span class="smcap">Peter</span> <i>comes forward and leans on rake to<br />
talk with him.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> Well, your Highness?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince.</span> That's right, Peter. Now you just tell me what you
like about it so awfully much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> Why, your Highness, you know I'm a poor boy and I've
always had to work. This is such pretty work&mdash;it's just like play.
And I never really had enough to eat until I came here to live. I
tell you it's horrid to be hungry! Then the good Fathers are so kind,
and I love the Christmas carols and the chimes&mdash;why, I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">-163-</a></span> it's a
beautiful place, your Highness. Don't you like to watch the toys grow?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince.</span> Oh, they grow so slow. I expected to have a
bushelful of new toys every month, and not one have I had yet. And
these stingy old Monks say that I can only have my usual Christmas
share, anyway, and I mayn't pick them myself, either. I never saw
such a stupid place to stay, in all my life. I want to have my velvet
tunic on and go home to the palace and ride on my white pony with the
silver tail, and hear them all tell me how charming I am. [<i>His words
become nearly a wail, and he rubs his fists in his eyes.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span> [<i>patting him sympathetically on the shoulder</i>]. Never
mind, your Highness. It's pretty nearly Christmas now, and in a few
days the toys will be ready to pick. Come along, and I'll help you to
water those tin soldiers over there&mdash;you didn't get that done, did
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince</span> [<i>jumps up angrily and stamps his foot</i>]. No, and I
won't do it, either. As for you, Peter, you're <i>tame</i>. If you had a
grain of spirit you'd hate it just as much as I do. There! [<i>Runs
off angrily (L.).</i> <span class="smcap">Peter</span> <i>looks after him, shakes his head,
gathers tools together neatly, takes up watering-can, and exit (R.).
Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Prince</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince</span> [<i>looking after</i> <span class="smcap">Peter</span>]. There he goes now
to water those horrid soldiers. I'd like to melt them all down to
lumps of lead&mdash;I would! And Peter&mdash;he's enough to drive me crazy. I
won't stay here a bit longer, so I won't. I'll get that ladder out of
the tool house and get over the wall and go home. [<i>Starts off.</i>] But
I'll take some Christmas presents with me, I know! [<i>Exit (L.). Enter
(R.)</i> <span class="smcap">Sebastian</span>, <span class="smcap">Felix</span>, <span class="smcap">Anselm</span>, <i>and</i>
<span class="smcap">Gregory</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anselm.</span> Well, Brethren, we have every cause to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">-164-</a></span> rejoice in
the fine flourishing condition of our garden. Peter has kept the beds
wonderfully clear of weeds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregory.</span> Yes, and I think I may say that our garden has
never been so fine as this year. It was a happy day for us when we
found Peter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Felix.</span> Indeed it was. How neatly he keeps the garden paths
raked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anselm.</span> And what a good disposition the child has!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Felix.</span> Always ready and willing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sebastian</span> [<i>who has stood at one side with folded arms and
dejected countenance</i>]. Peter. Peter. Peter. But what of the Prince?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anselm.</span> Alas, yes. You are right, Brother Sebastian. What of
the Prince?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregory.</span> Oh, I'm not utterly hopeless of the Prince, my
Brethren.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sebastian.</span> Brother Gregory is always over-hopeful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Felix.</span> It is my solemn opinion, Brethren, that the Prince is
the very worst boy in the Kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anselm.</span> Oh, no, Brother Felix!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sebastian.</span> I say he is! Think of the first day, when we
gave him Noah's ark seed to sow, and he went into a passion because
it wasn't gold-watch seed! [<i>The Monks nod regretfully.</i>] We set him
a penance to kneel on dried pease in the chapel all afternoon. And
hasn't it been so every other day in the year since?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anselm</span> [<i>soothingly</i>]. Yes, Brother Sebastian, I fear it
has. [<i>Cheerfully.</i>] But, then, you know, this has come hardest on
you&mdash;hasn't it, my Brethren? For, you see, the Prince exhausted our
list of penances so soon and you have had to remain in solitary
confinement in your cell in order that you might invent new penances
for him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">-165-</a></span> Hasn't it been too hard for poor Brother Sebastian,
Brethren?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregory.</span> Yes, yes, poor fellow, he looks quite thin and worn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Felix.</span> And to think how we were deceived in that boy! How
his people praised him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sebastian</span> [<i>gloomily</i>]. I fear his Royal relatives are sadly
deceived in him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregory.</span> But let us think of pleasanter subjects, for I have
hopes that the softening influences of the Christmas season will do
great things for our misguided young friend. Let us give our minds to
the contemplation of the Doll bed. How lovely the little creatures
are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Felix.</span> And how they will delight the hearts of the little
girls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anselm.</span> Why, why, why, what is this? Here is a vacant place!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregory.</span> Oh, yes, Brother, that doll didn't come up. I
noticed the place long ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Felix.</span> And so did I, but I neglected to speak of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregory</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Anselm</span>, <i>who continues to shake his
head over the missing doll</i>]. Come, come, Brother, let us be glad
that such cases are rare. Now, my Brethren, we will go on with our
inspection. [<i>They move towards exit, then, looking back, discover</i>
<span class="smcap">Sebastian</span> <i>still in gloomy revery.</i> <span class="smcap">Felix</span> <i>goes
back, puts an arm across his shoulder, and guides him gently after
the others.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregory.</span> Poor fellow! Poor fellow! [<i>Exeunt slowly (R.).
Enter (L.)</i> <span class="smcap">Rosalia</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalia</span> [<i>looking about with delight</i>]. Oh, the lovely
dollies. [<i>Examines them.</i>] And there comes Peter! [<i>Enter</i>
<span class="smcap">Peter</span> <i>(R.).</i> <span class="smcap">Rosalia</span> <i>goes to meet him.</i>] Peter!
Peter!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">-166-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span> [<i>amazed</i>]. Oh, you darling! How in the world did you
get in here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalia.</span> I just crept in behind one of the Monks. I saw him
going along the street, and I ran after him, and when he opened the
big gates I just crept in. Here I am, Peter!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span> [<i>worried</i>]. Well, I don't see what I am going to do
with you, now you <i>are</i> here. I can't let you out again, and I don't
know whatever the Monks would say!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalia.</span> Oh, I know! I'll stay out here in the garden. I'll
sleep in one of those beautiful dolly-cradles over there, and you can
bring me something to eat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> But the Monks come out very often to look over the
garden, and they'll be sure to find you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalia.</span> No, I'll hide. Oh, Peter, see that place where
there isn't any dolly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> Yes, that doll didn't come up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalia.</span> I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll just stand here
in her place and nobody can tell the difference. [<i>Steps into place
among dolls.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> Well, I suppose you can do that. [<i>Looks at her and
shakes his head anxiously.</i>] Of course, I'm glad as glad can be to
see you, but I'm afraid the Monks wouldn't like it. Now I must go
and put away my tools. Be very quiet, sister. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Peter</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince</span> [<i>without</i>]. Oh, I'm not hurt! Let us get away!
Hasten, my lords, hasten! [<i>Voices die away in the distance.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalia</span> [<i>horrified</i>]. What a naughty boy! [<i>Enter</i>
<span class="smcap">Peter</span> <i>(L.).</i>] Oh, Peter, the Prince has run away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span> [<i>hurriedly examining ladder, etc.</i>]. Run away?
[<i>Mounts ladder and looks over wall.</i>] He surely has! There he goes
on the horse with that gentleman! [<i>Watching, thoughtfully.</i>] I was
afraid he would try that! But this ladder [<i>getting down</i>] has always
been kept locked up. Oh, too bad,&mdash;most of the toys are broken.
[<i>Gathers them up and takes ladder.</i>] Keep very still, sister. I must
put these away and tell the Abbot and the other Fathers what has
happened. [<i>Exit (L.). Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Anselmus</span> <i>(R.), walking up and

this doll on crutches, which is&mdash;alive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion.</span> Rather a lame miracle.</p>

have been engaged, to wit, taking charge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">-169-</a></span> the funny picture-books
and the monkeys and jumping jacks, has rather thrown your mind off
its level of sobriety, and caused in you a tendency to make frivolous
remarks, unbecoming a Monk.</p>

<h3>ACT III</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span>: <i>Christmas morning.</i></p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>The Convent chapel, decorated with Christmas greens,
candles, etc. A picture of the Madonna and Child wreathed in green.
On a daïs (back Center), in the</i> <span class="smcap">Abbot's</span> <i>chair, dressed in
white with a wreath on her head, is seated little</i> <span class="smcap">Rosalia</span>.
<i>She sings a simple little Christmas hymn. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Peter</span>,
<i>with an air of secrecy, sitting down at</i> <span class="smcap">Rosalia's</span> <i>feet.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> Oh, sister, I feel so miserable!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalia.</span> Why, Peter? I think it is just beautiful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> Oh, yes, of course it is beautiful, and that's the
very worst part of it. I mean, you know, that just because it is
so beautiful, and the good Fathers are so very dreadfully kind,
that I feel worse than ever. Oh, dear! I'm not saying what I mean a
bit, sister, but, you see, I hate not to tell the Fathers the truth
about you, and on Christmas day, too. You know they think that you
are a live doll, and a miracle, and you're no such thing. You're
just Peter's little sister, aren't you, pet? And they have been so
kind, and Father Ambrose has made your poor little ankle so nice and
well&mdash;&mdash; So it makes me feel horrid to think we're deceiving them.
Why, it's 'most as bad as telling a story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalia</span> [<i>patting</i> <span class="smcap">Peter's</span> <i>shoulder</i>]. Poor Peter,
I'm so sorry!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> What shall we do about it, sister?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">-171-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalia.</span> Why, Peter, I'll tell them. They're all so kind, I
don't think they will be cross.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> Well, sister, I don't believe they will, either.
And it's Christmas day, so I want to be sure to do what is right.
And this is right&mdash;I am sure of that. Now I must run away; they'll
be coming soon. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Peter</span>. <i>Sound of Monks singing in
the distance grows louder and louder. Enter Monks</i>, <span class="smcap">Abbot</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalia.</span> Please, I'm not a miracle. I'm only Peter's little
sister!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Felix</span>, <span class="smcap">Ambrose</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sebastian</span>. Peter!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anselm</span>, <span class="smcap">Hilarion</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Peter's

<p class="right">

<p class="right">
[<i>Monks turn, each looking in the eyes of the<br />

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gregory.</span> Surely, here's an opportunity for a whole convent

<p><span class="smcap">Ambrose.</span> With our hands full of gifts&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sebastian.</span> To offer them to a miracle&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Felix.</span> And then to find out that this miracle&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hilarion.</span> This famous miracle is nothing but Peter's little
sister! [<span class="smcap">Hilarion</span> <i>doubles up with laughter, but controls
himself as the</i> <span class="smcap">Abbot</span> <i>lifts his hand for order.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbot.</span> My children, harken to me. Haven't I always
maintained that there are two ways of looking at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">-172-</a></span> anything? If an
object is not what we wish it to be in one light, let us see if there
is not some other light under which it will surely meet our views.
This dear little girl is a little girl and not a doll, that is true.
She did not come up in the place of the wax doll, and she is not a
miracle in that light. But look at her in another light, and surely
she is a miracle&mdash;do you not see? Look at her, the darling little
girl, isn't the very meaning and sweetness of all Christmas in her
loving, trusting, innocent little face?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Monks.</span> Yes, yes, she is a miracle, a miracle, indeed!</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Monks come forward and lay the toys at<br />
her feet.</i> <span class="smcap">Peter</span> <i>fairly hugs himself with
joy.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbot.</span> And, Peter? Where is Peter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span> [<i>coming forward</i>]. Here I am, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbot.</span> Peter, we feel so happy this beautiful Christmas
Day, that we must find some expression for our joy&mdash;we must surely
find a way to share such happiness with others. Run, my son, open
the Convent gates, and bid all the village people who wait there
for our usual gifts to enter and take part in our pleasure. [<i>Exit</i>
<span class="smcap">Peter</span> <i>in haste.</i>] Think, my children, what a gift we have
here for the poor parents of Peter and little Rosalia&mdash;this dear
little girl will be restored to them, not lame, as she was when she
wandered here, but well and strong and happy like other little ones.
Think of it, my children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbot.</span> How, now! What's this? [<i>Breaking seal and reading

a message from His Majesty, the King. He tells us that his son, the
Prince, reached his palace in safety, and that he has come to feel
great regret for all the trouble and anxiety he caused the Christmas
Monks. He hopes that the Prince's repentance, though late, will help
to season our Christmas and make it a happy one. And his Majesty adds
that he finds great improvement in his son. Well! Well! this does
indeed add yet another happiness to our day. [<i>To the people.</i>] And
I know you all, little and big, are just as happy as we are, for at

<h3>NOTES ON COSTUME AND PRESENTATION</h3>

<p class="blockquot">(Mrs. Freeman's story of the same name, from which this little play
was taken, has delightful illustrations which would be of help in
making the monks' costumes. It appeared first in <i>Wide Awake</i>, Volume
16, and was later published in a collection of Mrs. Freeman's short
stories, entitled "The Pot of Gold.")</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Abbot</span> (taken by an adult), and</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Brethren</span> of the Convent (boys, sixteen to eighteen)
wear long hooded robes made of white canton flannel. Greek patterns
in green are stenciled at hem of skirt and around the wide sleeves.
A rope of ground pine, or other Christmas wreathing, is worn for
a girdle, ends hanging, and the tonsures are made by wearing
close-fitting skull-caps of flesh-colored silk or sateen, with a
wreath of green at the edge.</p>

<p>When <span class="smcap">Peter</span> and the <span class="smcap">Prince</span> come to the Garden their
dress is the same, but their Greek borders should be smaller and
they wear no tonsures. They are boys of ten. Hoods of all are worn
hanging, except that of Brother <span class="smcap">Sebastian</span>, who in the 2nd
Act goes gloomily hooded. All wear sandals and white stockings.</p>

<p>As the story suggests neither country nor period, there may be a good
deal of latitude in the matter of costumes for the rest of the cast,
but the court party in the first act should be as resplendent as
possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Prince.</span> Plumed hat, short trousers, slippers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">-175-</a></span> with bows,
coat with broad lace collar and cuffs. Very long cloak, borne behind
him by the</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pages.</span> Dressed alike in a style somewhat resembling the
Prince.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Courtier.</span> The same, with the addition of a short cape, and a
sword.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Court Lady.</span> Dress made with a train and a high beaded
collar. The boy and girl playing these parts are also Peter's Father
and Mother in the last act.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistress Longlane</span> and <span class="smcap">Mistress Spinning</span>, and the
little Village girls wear large poke bonnets, old-fashioned shawls or
white kerchiefs, and mitts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> Neat, but old and faded blouse and knickerbockers.
Cap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Rosalia.</span> Quaint smocked dress, of soft blue, a
Persian border at hem, square neck, and short sleeves. (Or, white,
with blue borders.) Small cap, trimmed in the same way. She is lame
and walks with crutches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter's Father</span> and <span class="smcap">Mother</span>. Poorly and roughly
dressed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gilbert</span>, the Carpenter's Apprentice. Blue denim apron.
Carries T-square.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robin</span>, the Forester's Son. Sleeveless green coat, over a
white shirt with full sleeves; full trousers; broad felt hat, turned
up on one side with a quill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter</span>, the Miller's Son. White apron. Dusty felt hat.</p>

<p class="blockquot">(If preferred, instead of using the above suggestions for costumes,
the Randolph Caldecott pictures, or Kate Greenaway illustrations of
"Mother Goose," may be adopted as a scheme for dressing all but the
Monks.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">-176-</a></span></p>

<p>The entrance and exit of the Monks is always heralded by their
singing. Their song may be one of the well-known Christmas carols
containing a few Latin words, but a Latin chant is most effective,
such as can be found in the little Sunday-school hymnals of the Roman
Catholic Church. Suggestions for <span class="smcap">Rosalia's</span> song and the
carol at the end of the play will be found on <a href="#Page_315">p. 315</a>.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Setting</span></h4>

<p>For the Garden wall, a frame must be made sufficiently strong to bear
the weight of the Prince, and may need special bracing at the central
point where he climbs over. He uses a small ladder, preferably a
red-painted one, like those in children's ladder-wagon sets. The
framework of the wall may be covered with paper, but unbleached
muslin is much more substantial and lasting. On this is painted the
wall, representing either brick or stone, with a stone coping, all
quaintly stained and moss-grown. It is five or six feet in height.</p>

<p>The beds where the toys grow are outlined in green. Dolls as large
as possible should be used in the back row, in order to prevent the
contrast with little Rosalia from being too great. Smaller dolls may
be used in the front rows. The number depends on the size of the
stage and the possibilities for borrowing. They may be made to stand
with wooden braces, but it will be found convenient if milliners'
stands for displaying hats can be obtained, as they are light and can
be easily set in place. For the other bed, two or three small bare
bushes, on the branches of which can be fastened such toys as whips,
tin trumpets, etc. Small wheelbarrow, watering-pot, and other garden
tools scattered about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">-177-</a></span></p>

<p>For the last scene, the walls should be plain and dark in color. The
Abbot's chair is large and ecclesiastical, and Rosalia looks, in it,
like the doll for which the Monks mistook her. Two great candles, in
tall candlesticks, on the daïs beside her, are effective. No other
furniture.</p>

<h3>SCENE I</h3>

<p class="bp"><i>A chamber or corridor in the Manor House. Door [L.]. Hangings on
wall.</i> <span class="smcap">Gillian</span> <i>seated [R.], with the three children about
her, all working at wreaths and garlands, and singing an old carol.
Curtain rises on second verse. While they sing</i>, <span class="smcap">Diccon</span>
<i>enters. Takes up sword or other piece of armor from table [L.] and
begins to polish it.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely</span> [<i>with a deep sigh</i>]. Good Gillian, methinks that
though we sang our carols o'er and o'er we could not make it seem
like Christmas-tide. Brother Rufus is gone away, and we may not even
say we miss him. I would I knew&mdash;&mdash; [<i>Chin on hand.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian.</span> You would you knew what, little mistress mine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely.</span> I would I knew what is wrong with us. Christmas was
ever such a merry season in this dear house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe</span> [<i>wisely</i>]. 'Tis because my father goeth about wearing
such a stern face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Allison.</span> And Mother looketh <i>so</i> sad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely</span> [<i>confidentially</i>]. And I think cousin Phyllis cries
in her chamber sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diccon</span> [<i>mutters</i>]. Meseemeth we should all know right well

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian.</span> Hist, Diccon [<i>warning gesture</i>].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diccon.</span> &mdash;&mdash;and more than that, under a cloud&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian.</span> Be silent, I say, Diccon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diccon</span> [<i>paying no heed</i>]. 'Tis young Master Rufus this
house needs so sorely, I'm thinking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Gilbert</span> [<i>striding forward angrily</i>]. Silence, I say.
Have I not given command that my son's name shall not pass the lips
of any of my people? I will be obeyed in mine own house. Diccon,
hence! Thou canst spend thy days in the stables caring for my horses,
an thou'lt not learn to bridle thy tongue. Mayhap the dumb beasts
will teach thee a lesson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diccon</span> [<i>bowing humbly</i>]. I crave pardon, Sir Gilbert. I but
thought&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir G.</span> Enough. [<i>Turns to table. Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Diccon</span>,
<i>with an awkward bow.</i>] Gillian, let this be a warning to you as
well. I have laid my commands&mdash;I will be obeyed. [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe.</span> 'Tis very hard to be just children, when anything's
wrong, I think. We may not know what our elders do know, and yet we
must be just as uncomfortable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian.</span> Tst-tst, my lambs! Let us think of other things.
Shall we measure our garlands? [<i>Stretches out her green.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe</span> [<i>measuring his against it, while</i> <span class="smcap">Cicely</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Allison</span> <i>stretch theirs together</i>]. Indeed, 'tis soon
done, good Gillian. We've used up all our greens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian</span> [<i>rising</i>]. I will see if Roger and Noll have
brought more for us. [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe</span> [<i>considering his garland</i>]. Would my garland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">-183-</a></span> measure
around the great pasty Dame Joan hath made for to-morrow's feast,
think you, Cicely?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely</span> [<i>laughing</i>]. The venison pasty, Rafe? Mayhap when
Dame Joan hath turned her back, we can try and see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Allison.</span> I fear mine will but reach around a very little
pudding! [<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Phyllis</span>.] Oh, cousin Phyllis, cousin
Phyllis, come see our garlands!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phyllis</span> [<i>coming forward</i>]. Did my little Allison wreathe
all this long piece? [<span class="smcap">Allison</span> <i>nods proudly.</i>] That's brave
work, indeed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely</span> [<i>arms around</i> <span class="smcap">Phyllis</span>]. Dear cousin
Phyllis, won't you stay and help us&mdash;and tell us why everyone is so
sad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phyllis</span> [<i>frightened</i>]. Nay, dear, I must not, and you must
not be sad&mdash;'tis Christmas Eve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe.</span> Yes, we know. But <i>why</i> doth my father look so
stern&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phyllis.</span> Nay, nay&mdash;I may not speak of it. My aunt will be
sore displeased.</p>

with the children? To thy tasks, girl!</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Exit.</i><br />

<p><span class="smcap">Phyllis</span> [<i>turning hastily to follow</i>]. You see, sweethearts,
I must not tarry. But I wish good speed to your garlands. Farewell.
[<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely.</span> Thou dost see, Rafe. Father will not let us speak of
brother Rufus, and Mother is so cross to poor cousin Phyllis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Allison</span> [<i>shocked</i>]. Nay, Cicely; Mother isn't cross. It's
naughty to say that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe.</span> I think I know what it is all about. [<i>Very
confidentially. Girls draw their chairs close.</i>] I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">-184-</a></span> brother
Rufus ran away to the wars to fight for the King&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely.</span> But, Rafe, that can't be what displeaseth Father,
for Father is a soldier, too, and he himself will fight for our lord
the King, if so be the King needeth him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Allison</span> [<i>nodding her head with conviction</i>]. Father is the
most gallantest soldier in all the country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe.</span> But I do think that is why Father is so angry with
brother Rufus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely.</span> And why is Mother so&mdash;so unkind to poor cousin
Phyllis?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe</span> [<i>very solemnly</i>]. Because&mdash;because Rufus did say that
when he was come of age and was a man he would <i>marry</i> cousin Phyllis!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely.</span> Oh! But <i>I</i> think that's very, <i>very</i> nice! Why
doesn't Mother like it, Rafe? They'd never go away to any other house
at all&mdash;and then, beside,&mdash;Allison and I could be their bride-maidens!</p>

[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Gillian</span> <i>with an armful of greens.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian</span> [<i>sitting down among them</i>]. Here's work for us all,
my pets. We must e'en make our fingers fly an we would finish our
task.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely</span> [<i>full of importance</i>]. Oh, good Gillian, Rafe doth
say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe</span> [<i>trying to repress her</i>]. It's no use to ask Gillian,
Cicely. Didst not hear my Father tell her she mustn't talk of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian.</span> That's best, Master Rafe. Let Gillian tell you a
tale whilst we work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Allison.</span> A fairy-tale, Gillian? [<i>Whispers full of awe.</i>]
Are the <i>fairies</i> about to-night, dear Gillian?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe.</span> Not on Christmas Eve, Allison. They aren't,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">-185-</a></span> are they,
Gillian? Midsummer Eve is the fairies' night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely.</span> And fairies have no power on Christmas Eve, and
witches can't charm you, nor cast their spells upon you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe.</span> Because 'tis such a holy, holy night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian.</span> Oh, but there be wonderful things that do befall on
Christmas Eve, Master Rafe. My old grandam used to say that when the
midnight bells ring, the cattle in the stables do kneel down to hail
the holy day!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely.</span> Oh, Gillian, <i>do</i> they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe.</span> Hast ever seen them, Gillian? Or hath thy grandam?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Allison.</span> All the cows, and the sheep, and the little, little
lambs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian.</span> Nay, sweetheart, I never saw them, but I was wont
to think, each Christmas Eve, that I would surely creep out to the
stables and keep watch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe.</span> And did you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian.</span> Oh, Master Rafe, in truth 'twas a pretty plan,&mdash;but
I was not a very brave little wench,&mdash;and it was so cold and dark and
fearsome: when the time was come, I was always fain to put it off
until the next year!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe</span> [<i>scornfully</i>]. Sooth! I would never do that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian.</span> Nay, that I'll warrant, Master Rafe! But let
me tell thee what else my grandam hath told me. 'Twas about the
portraits in the long gallery in this very house.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Diccon</span>, <i>with armful of wood for fire,<br />
which he piles upon the hearth.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely.</span> The portraits&mdash;&mdash; Oh, yes, Gillian. [<i>Draws close
to</i> <span class="smcap">Gillian</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">-186-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe.</span> I know. Our great-great-grandfather and our
great-great-grandmother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely.</span> Bethink thee, Rafe&mdash;what are their names? I do
forget.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe.</span> They are Sir Philip and Lady Geraldine Underhill. And
they lived right here in this very house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diccon</span> [<i>turning from hearth</i>]. Yes, Master Rafe, they lived
in this house. He was a passing gallant gentleman, and fought for
the King, and she was as beautiful as he was brave, and as brave as
she was beautiful. And they say that in a great war his enemies came
to search this house for him, but he and my lady hid themselves in a
secret chamber that's long since forgot. But 'tis somewhere in the
house,&mdash;&mdash; [<i>looks about as if expecting to find door at once</i>] if a
body just but knew how to find the door&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian</span> [<i>in contempt</i>]. Nay, nay, Diccon. I'll warrant me
the Master knoweth where that door is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diccon.</span> Mayhap Sir Gilbert doth know. But none else may find
it. Many's the time the lads ha' looked for it&mdash;many's the time.
[<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p class="right">
[<span class="smcap">Rafe</span> <i>goes about for a moment, lifting hangings,<br />
etc., as if in search for door, but returns<br />
to</i> <span class="smcap">Gillian's</span> <i>side to hear her answer
to</i> <span class="smcap">Cicely</span>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely.</span> But, Gillian, what was it thy grandam told about the
portraits?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian.</span> Oh, verily, my sweet. Thinking about the secret
door I had well-nigh forgot. My grandam said that if all the house
was still and sleeping, just on the stroke of twelve every Christmas
Eve, Sir Philip and my Lady Geraldine do move and breathe, step forth
from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">-187-</a></span> their picture frames, clasp hands, and move together in an
ancient dance!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe.</span> <i>Do</i> they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Allison</span>. Oh-h-h! [<i>Drawing near to</i>
<span class="smcap">Gillian</span> <i>with a little delighted shiver.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady K.</span> [<i>without</i>]. Gillian, Gillian! Come hither, wench; I
need thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian</span> [<i>rising</i>]. Anon, my lady! [<i>To children.</i>] Think
of it, bairns&mdash;that fine brave gentleman and that beautiful lady,
stepping across the floors in the moonlight&mdash;&mdash; [<i>Exit, hand lifted
as if holding a partner's, taking stately dancing steps.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely.</span> Oh, Rafe, think'st that Gillian speaketh true?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe.</span> Yes, I do believe her. Christmas is such a marvelous
fair time, Cicely, that I do think <i>any</i>thing wonderful might happen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Allison.</span> I would I could <i>see</i> Sir Philip and Lady Geraldine
at their dancing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely.</span> Oh, so do I! Rafe, dost think&mdash;&mdash; [<i>Hesitates,
afraid to speak her thought.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe</span> [<i>boldly</i>]. I think&mdash;that if my lord and my lady do
dance&mdash;we shall see them this very Christmas Eve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely.</span> Oh, Rafe, what dost mean us to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe.</span> When the great doors are closed at eleven o'clock&mdash;I
always hear Diccon making them fast&mdash;I'll sit up in my bed, so that
I can't by mischance fall asleep. Then I will wake thee and Allison,
and we will steal into the long gallery and hide ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely.</span> But if Sir Philip and Lady Geraldine see us, mayhap
they'll be displeased and not come forth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe.</span> But if we go soon enough they can't see us, because
they don't come alive until twelve o'clock. Until the clock strikes,
they're only pictures, Cicely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">-188-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely.</span> Verily, I did forget.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe.</span> I mean to make sure the nursery door which giveth on
the back passage is left unlocked and open, or mayhap I might fail to
hear. Come, sister, bring your wreaths. [<i>Goes toward door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phyllis.</span> Oh, Rufus, Rufus&mdash;not <i>you</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rufus.</span> Yes, 'tis I, fair cousin. I prithee speak softly. I
would not have it known as yet that I am here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phyllis.</span> But whence came you, Rufus? We thought you miles
away, with the King's troops&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rufus.</span> My company made a secret march, across this valley,
and I thought to spend Christmas in mine own dear home. My Captain
gave me leave to come here to-night, and join him to-morrow eve. But
after I set out on my solitary march, a company of Roundhead rebels
sprang up from a copse by the way and gave chase to our men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phyllis.</span> How knew you this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rufus.</span> I had come but a half-hour's walk, up the long hill,
and saw it all quite plainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phyllis</span> [<i>much troubled</i>]. But, Rufus, then you are cut off
from the King's men, for there be very many rebels and few loyal
hearts about us, in these parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">-189-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rufus.</span> I know, Phyllis. And, furthermore, though I would
not alarm thee, I must tell thee that I was seen by that treacherous
Farmer Gosling on the road hither, and I fear he may set others like
himself upon my track.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phyllis.</span> Oh, Rufus, you frighten me so&mdash;they will surely
come and take you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rufus.</span> Aye, they will try, dear cousin. But I've safe harbor
in my father's house, and when darkness comes I can put forth once
more and rejoin our men in the North.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phyllis.</span> A safe harbor, saidst thou! Thou little knowest&mdash;&mdash;
Hark! someone comes. Hide thee speedily, Rufus. Here, behind

Gilbert</span> <i>sits moodily in chair by fire.</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Katherine</span>
<i>stands before him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir G.</span> [<i>as they enter</i>]. I tell thee, I will hear no more
of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady K.</span> But, my lord, this day have I heard a rumor that a
band of King's men were near us&mdash;here in this nest of rebel enemies!
If there were fighting&mdash;if my boy Rufus were in danger, and I might
not succor him, 'twould go nigh to kill me. And so, my lord, I'm come
once more to crave pardon for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir G.</span> I tell thee, it will not be granted thee. When the
boy disobeyed me and ran away I disowned him. I vowed he should never
enter these doors again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady K.</span> My lord, the lad was so eager to serve his King.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir G.</span> [<i>springs up and paces the floor</i>]. Did I forbid
him to serve his King? Nay, when the time was come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">-190-</a></span> he should have
gone with me, with horse and arms, in state befitting a gentleman's
son. And so I told him. I told him he was full young yet&mdash;the lad is
scarce turned seventeen. Eagerness to serve his King, forsooth! 'Twas
mere idleness. He chose to run away from his tasks and his studies.
Beshrew me! Whether he find the camp life of a common soldier a bed
of roses or no, I care not. He must e'en lie in it. I'll neither
grant him pardon, nor receive him in my house. To consort with common
soldiers and camp ruffians&mdash;he hath disgraced my name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady K.</span> Oh, my poor lad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir G.</span> Thou and Phyllis need not grieve so foolishly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady K.</span> [<i>stiffens angrily</i>]. Phyllis! She is the one reason
why I am reconciled to his being away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir G.</span> [<i>more gently</i>]. Come, good wife, be not so hard upon
poor Phyllis. She's a good maid and a fair. What if the lad have
turned her head a bit? I would fain have thee remember the lass is an
orphan and we her only kinsfolk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady K.</span> [<i>moving away</i>]. I care not to talk of Phyllis.
[<i>Turns back.</i>] Will nothing move you, my lord?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir G.</span> [<i>hardening</i>]. I've told you my mind&mdash;let's hear no
more of this. [<i>Exeunt (L.).</i> <span class="smcap">Rufus</span> <i>comes from hiding-place
and stands sadly by fire. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Phyllis</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rufus</span> [<i>turning toward her</i>]. Why, Phyllis, I little guessed
my father could be so hard and stern. I knew I had displeased him,
but <i>this</i> passeth belief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phyllis.</span> He is very unforgiving. When you called this house
a safe harbor, you little knew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rufus</span> [<i>turning as if to go</i>]. So be it, then. If my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">-191-</a></span> father
cannot forgive me,&mdash;I'll e'en forth to the tender mercies of mine
enemies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phyllis</span> [<i>alarmed</i>]. Oh, no, no, Rufus! At least do not
venture forth until the dark hath come! No one must see you here.
Come into the blue guest chamber. 'Tis not a secure hiding-place
should the house be searched, but 'twill serve for the time, and by
midnight you may steal away safely. Do come, Rufus! [<i>He lets her

<p><span class="smcap">Diccon</span> [<i>calling softly</i>]. Gillian, Gillian! Hang the wench!
Wilt not wait, good Gillian? I've somewhat of great import to tell
thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian</span> [<i>impatiently</i>]. Were I to believe thee, Master
Diccon, <i>all</i> thine affairs are of great matter. Mayhap thou thinkest
<i>my</i> business is ever of small consequence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diccon.</span> Nay, then, Gillian&mdash;but this news is thine and mine
and my lord's and my lady's too!</p>

<p class="right">
[<span class="smcap">Gillian</span> <i>turns, a little curious, and waits for

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">-193-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian</span> [<i>scornfully</i>]. A strange matter, methinks, that can
be thine and mine and theirs, too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diccon.</span> But list a moment, and you shall hear. Giles, the
horse-boy, hath been in the village this day, and heard that which
bodes ill to us. Giles heard them talking in the tavern&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian.</span> Heard whom talking, Diccon? I can make naught of
thy twisting tales!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diccon.</span> Why, the Roundhead knaves, be sure. And the pith and
kernel of Giles' tale&mdash;an thou'lt not hear the how and the when&mdash;is
this! that they mean to come hither this night and search our house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian</span> [<i>gives a little scream and claps her hand over her
mouth</i>]. Oh, Diccon, Diccon,&mdash;what can they want here? We be peaceful
folk. In sooth 'tis known we are all good King's men, but no harm
have we done to any! Oh, Diccon!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diccon.</span> Sst! silly wench! They'll not harm thee. But hark to
what else Giles heard. They be coming to search for Master Rufus!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian.</span> Master Rufus! But he hath not been here these many
weeks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diccon.</span> Sst! Speak more cautiously, Gillian. The knaves did
say they have certain knowledge that Master Rufus is here in hiding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian</span> [<i>looking fearfully and suspiciously about</i>]. Oh,
Diccon, dost believe it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diccon.</span> In good sooth, how can I tell? But I am in great
fear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian.</span> Thou afeard, Diccon? Oh, what dost think the
Roundhead villains will do to us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diccon</span> [<i>angrily</i>]. A pest upon thee, wench! They'll do
naught to <i>us</i>! 'Tis for my young master I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">-194-</a></span> am troubled. If they take
him, 'tis doubtless to a rebel prison he'll go, and then&mdash;it's rough
fare for such a young lad,&mdash;and gentle born and bred to boot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian</span> [<i>curiously</i>]. But can he be here, think you, Diccon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diccon</span> [<i>anxiously</i>]. He may be. And I do fear to ask my

minuet as is practicable for two alone.<br />
When this has continued as long as is desirable,<br />
there is a sudden noise without.<br />
Instantly the music ceases and the figures<br />
go back with all swiftness and resume<br />

startled.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely</span> [<i>in alarmed whisper</i>]. Oh, Rafe, what was that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely</span> [<i>aloud, but still cautious, though in great
fright</i>]. Oh, Rafe&mdash;I saw a man! Who was that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Allison.</span> So did I, sister! Let's <i>run</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely.</span> Mother! Mother! I'm frightened!</p>

[<i>Both rush screaming out of door (L.).</i> <span class="smcap">Rafe</span><br />

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe.</span> That was brother Rufus. I wonder how he came
hither.... And there is someone ... away out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">-196-</a></span> there in the snow ...
men ... coming this way. [<i>Leaves window and stands directly in front
of portraits, with his back to them, and a little way off. Stares
anxiously straight before him, and speaks low and quietly.</i>] Perhaps
they are soldiers ... or wicked people come to seek for him and take
him away.... Rufus went up the little stairs to the Tower.... There's
no place to hide in the Tower! [<i>His voice gradually rising.</i>]
They'll find him as soon as they get here.... Oh, <i>what</i> shall I
do&mdash;what shall I do? [<i>Stands with hands clenched, listening and
thinking, wide-eyed. The portraits move and bend toward him.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Geraldine</span> [<i>leaning forward and smiling tenderly</i>].
Little Rafe, little Rafe, thou must play the man this night!</p>

Little lad, little lad, thou art little and young! Go and fetch thy
father!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe</span> [<i>breathless</i>]. You needs must listen, Father! Brother
Rufus came in at this door and went to the window, softly, to peep
out. Then he ran out again and I got me up speedily and ran to the

<h3>NOTES ON COSTUME, MUSIC, AND SETTING</h3>

<p>Adult parts in this play taken by boys and girls of fifteen or
sixteen. In contrast to these, the smaller the children playing Rafe,
Cicely, and Allison, the better&mdash;Rafe not over eight, Cicely and
Allison six and five years.</p>

<p>Costumes follow the Van Dyke pictures of Charles I and those of
his children. Very helpful illustrations may also be found in
"Merrylips," by Beulah Marie Dix. (The Macmillan Company.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Gilbert</span> and <span class="smcap">Rufus</span> wear sleeveless jerkins made
of tan-colored canton flannel to represent leather. Rufus wears boots
and a broad-brimmed hat with plumes, and long cloak of the same color
as his suit. These suits should be of rich colors in contrast to the
sober colors of the Puritan soldiers, who also wear leather-colored
jerkins and boots.</p>

<p>Cavaliers wear broad lace collars and cuffs, while the <span class="smcap">Puritan
Soldiers</span> wear square linen collars and cuffs, and under-sleeves
with stripes running around them of black and orange, the colors of
the Parliament. Orange baldric over right shoulder. If possible,
metal helmets, or firemen's helmets silvered to represent the steel
caps of the time; otherwise, broad-brimmed felt hats with band or
scarf of orange and black. They carry swords, cross-bows, or other
arms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Katherine</span> and <span class="smcap">Phyllis</span>. Full, quilted
petticoats, broad, deep-pointed lace collars and cuffs. Dressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">-206-</a></span> in
rich colors. Lady Katherine wears a small lace cap upon her hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rafe.</span> Suit like the picture of Prince Charles. May wear a
broad fringed sash, and fringed bows at his knees. Lace collar and
cuffs. Sleeves may be slashed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicely</span> and <span class="smcap">Allison</span>. Little short-waisted, quilted
dresses, with flowered panels set in. Lace at the square necks and
the elbow sleeves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gillian.</span> Plainly made dress of flowered material. Skirt
full, but not quilted. Short caps to the sleeves. White kerchief,
apron, and plain white cap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Diccon.</span> Plain suit, like the Puritans, but less sober in
color, and without the leather jerkin. Square linen collar and cuffs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Portraits.</span> Costumes of an earlier century.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Philip.</span> Slashed doublet and trunks of rich color, and
long stockings to match. Ruff, and plumed cap or hat of same material
as doublet. Wears a dagger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Geraldine.</span> Dress of rich color to harmonize with Sir
Philip's. Puffed and slashed sleeves, figured panel in front of skirt
and waist, and panniers on hips. Ruff, and small beaded cap.</p>

<p>To stand in absolute stillness for so long a time is a difficult
matter. Therefore the portraits must be careful to take poses which
they can hold without too great a strain throughout the act.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Music</span></h4>

<p>Choose songs which, through their quaintness, may be in keeping with
the atmosphere of the whole.</p>

"The first Nowell the angel did say,"<br />
</p>

<p>or some other simple old carol.</p>

<p>For the Waits:</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"From far away we come to you."<br />
</p>

<p>These three carols are all to be found in "Christmas Carols New and
Old," Novello &amp; Company. The last has been modernized and set to new
music more suitable for children's voices by Mr. W.W. Gilchrist,
and is to be found in a book containing many good carols for
children ("The First Nowell" among them), "The New Hosanna."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Mr.
Gilchrist's version omits the quaint refrains of the original&mdash;"The
snow in the street, and the wind on the door," and "Minstrels and
maids stand forth on the floor," and substitutes "Sing 'Glory to God'
again and again," and "Peace upon earth, good will to men." These
last words are necessary to the sense in two places, in the text
of the play. When the play was first given, the Waits used the old
refrains, and Mr. Gilchrist's, for alternate verses, thus gaining in
quaintness of effect and at the same time avoiding monotony. For the
midnight dance, use the Minuet from Mozart's "Don Giovanni."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Setting</span></h4>

<p>If the first scene, which requires little furniture,&mdash;the table, a
chair for Gillian, and low stools for the children,&mdash;can be set in
front of the second, much time will be saved in the changing. One
scene will serve for both acts, if the frames of the portraits can be
covered with hangings during the first act. Mission furniture may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">-208-</a></span>
be used, but if it is possible to obtain a carved chair and table,
and appropriate objects to hang upon the wall,&mdash;one or two pieces of
armor, a pair of antlers, etc.,&mdash;the effect can be much enhanced.</p>

<p>The secret door in the second act must be planned in accordance with
the possibilities of one's stage. If scenery is used, one section may
be opened wide enough for Rufus to pass through. Otherwise, arrange
hangings so that he may appear to go through a door behind them.</p>

Whence comes this rush of wings afar?<br />
Following straight the Noël star?<br />
Birds from the woods in wondrous flight,<br />
Bethlehem seek this Holy Night.<br />
<br />
2. "Tell us, ye birds, why come ye here,<br />
Into this stable, poor and drear?"<br />
"Hast'ning we seek the new-born King,<br />
And all our sweetest music bring."<br />

3. First came the Cock, ere break of day,<br />

Straight to the humble manger flew,<br />
Chanting aloud <i>Coquerico</i>.<br />

Chirping with mirth <i>Tir-li-chiu-chiu</i>;<br />

5. Blackbirds then raised their sweetest notes;<br />
Warbled the Linnets' tuneful throats!<br />
Pigeons all cooed <i>Rou-cou-rou-cou</i>,<br />

<p class="tp"><span class="smcap">Kolinka.</span> How lonely it is with Father away!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> Yes, and isn't it strange to think that all the
houses in the village are just as quiet as ours?&mdash;on Christmas Eve,
too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha.</span> I don't believe it ever happened before that the
whole village had to turn out and hunt wolves on Christmas Eve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> And if they hadn't had to do that I suppose Mother
wouldn't have had to spend the day taking care of Petrovitch's sick
wife, either.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kolinka.</span> If the men were at home somebody would be coming
in, or at least passing by.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> Oh, I do hope they will kill all those dreadful
wolves so we shan't have to be afraid any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matrena.</span> I'm so afraid Father will be hurt!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha</span> [<i>with scorn</i>]. <i>Hurt</i>, Matrena! Of course he won't
be hurt. Hasn't he always hunted wolves, every winter? But that's
the way with you and Kolinka. I tell you <i>I'm</i> not afraid. I only
wish I were older and bigger&mdash;then I could have gone, too. It's very
slow to have to stay at home and take care of you girls. [<i>Yawns and
stretches.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie</span> [<i>turning indignantly</i>]. Indeed, Sascha, it wouldn't
be slow at all if you would do something beside lie up there on the
stove and sleep. Here's the bowl you began to carve a month ago, not
finished yet. Just come down now, and do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha.</span> Oh, no! I like this better. And you know you would
rather have me stay up here and tell you the news. [<i>Teasingly.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kolinka.</span> News, indeed! What news can <i>you</i> have to tell, I
should like to know?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">-214-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha</span> [<i>triumphantly</i>]. Just this. That the great castle up
on the hill has been thrown open once more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie</span> [<i>surprised</i>]. <i>Has</i> it? Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kolinka.</span> I don't believe it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha.</span> It's true, though. Our father the Czar has pardoned
the Baron, and he has come back from Siberia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kolinka.</span> Are you <i>sure</i>, Sascha? Where is the Baroness?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha.</span> The men said so at the well this morning, so it must
be true.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matrena.</span> Did the Baron bring the little Prince and Princess
with him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha.</span> <i>Of course</i> my lady and the children weren't in
Siberia with the Baron. They've been in some foreign country&mdash;I
forget where&mdash;all these years. And now the Baron has sent for them,
and they have all come back to the castle to keep Christmas together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matrena.</span> Oh, how glad I am!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha.</span> What are you glad for? It won't make any difference
to <i>us</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matrena.</span> But I'm glad, anyway!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kolinka.</span> Of course she is, and so we all are, Sascha&mdash;glad
for the Baron and the lady, and the children, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nicolas.</span> Did you say they were coming here, Sascha?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pavlo.</span> Are we going to see them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha.</span> No, of course not. They've come to the castle, and
it will be the wonder of wonders if <i>we</i> see them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kolinka</span> [<i>kindly</i>]. Perhaps they will drive through the
village in their beautiful sleigh, Nicolas, and then you and Pavlo
will have a chance to see them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">-215-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha.</span> They did say, at the village well, that now the
Baron is home, there will be more strangers in the village again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> All the better for the village, and that's a very
good reason for you to come down and work, Sascha. We can sell what
we make to these same strangers, and earn a few kopeks for poor
Father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha.</span> That's so, Marie. [<i>Comes down ladder and begins
to examine work.</i>] I believe I'll make some more forks and spoons.
[<i>Consults</i> <span class="smcap">Marie</span> <i>in pantomime.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nicolas.</span> Let's play wolf hunt, Pavlo! I'll be a wolf&mdash;&mdash;
[<i>Covers himself with a skin.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pavlo.</span> And I'll be a hunter with a club! [<i>Jumps up and arms
himself.</i> <span class="smcap">Nicolas</span> <i>growls realistically.</i> <span class="smcap">Pavlo</span>
<i>prepares to strike.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kolinka</span> [<i>suddenly, in a startled voice</i>]. What's that
outside!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nicolas.</span> Bears!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pavlo.</span> No, it's a wolf! [<i>They throw down skin and club and
fly to the top of the stove.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pavlo</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Nicolas</span> [<i>terror-stricken</i>]. Wolf! Wolf!</p>

waked the baby!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kolinka.</span> Be quiet, boys! It's not a wolf at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matrena.</span> Nor a bear, either. [<i>Rocks cradle, and pats and
hushes baby.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> It's some poor body lost in the snow, perhaps.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">-216-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha</span> [<i>without</i>]. Have you lost your way? Come with me.
Here is our door. It's a bitter cold night.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kolinka</span> [<i>going forward hospitably</i>]. Come in; you are very
welcome. [<i>Sees the strange guests.</i>] Oh&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie</span> [<i>aside</i>]. Oh, Matrena, who can it be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matrena</span> [<i>aside</i>]. Marie, just see how beautifully they are
dressed!</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Children stand back abashed.</i> <span class="smcap">Sascha</span> <i>remains<br />
by door.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince</span> [<i>who leads</i> <span class="smcap">Princess</span> <i>by the hand</i>]. We
thank you for taking us in. I am the Prince Dimitri from the castle,
and this is my sister, the Princess Dagmar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> And we have lost our way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kolinka</span> [<i>timidly</i>]. We&mdash;we didn't know who it was. I'm so
glad we heard you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie</span> [<i>gently taking</i> <span class="smcap">Princess'</span> <i>hand</i>]. Oh,
Matrena, how cold her hand is! Come near our stove, my lady, and warm
yourself.</p>

<p class="right">
[<span class="smcap">Marie</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Matrena</span> <i>rub the</i> <span class="smcap">Princess'</span><br />

<i>stand staring at the strangers.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha.</span> How did you get lost?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince.</span> We wanted to see our beautiful forest&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> You see, we have only been here for a few days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince.</span> So we started out for a little walk. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">-217-</a></span> didn't mean
to go far at all, but before we knew it we had lost sight of the
castle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> And though we tried and tried to find it again, we
kept getting deeper into the forest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha.</span> But how did you come to the village? It isn't very
far from the castle, but it is hard to find unless you know the road,
or just the right path in the forest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kolinka.</span> Yes, how did you come here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> An old woman found us wandering about trying to
find the path, and she brought us here. Such a strange old woman, all
wrinkled and bent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince.</span> <i>She</i> seemed to know just how to come here, though I
couldn't tell what was guiding her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> And she was so good and kind to us&mdash;but she never
spoke once, all the way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie</span> [<i>clapping her hands</i>]. It must have been the Babushka!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha.</span> Of course it was!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kolinka</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Matrena</span>. How wonderful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nicolas</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Pavlo</span>. Babushka! Babushka!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince</span> [<i>puzzled</i>]. The Babushka?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Who is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha.</span> What! you, Russian children, and don't know that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kolinka</span> [<i>aside</i>]. Hush, Sascha, don't be rude. You forget
they have been away ever since they were babies, almost. [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Prince</span>.] We can tell you all about the Babushka, Prince.
Sit down, and Marie will tell you the story. Marie knows it best.

<p><span class="smcap">Nicolas.</span> There aren't any bears or wolves coming, Pavlo?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pavlo.</span> No. And Marie's going to tell a story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nicolas.</span> Let's get down. [<i>They scramble down the ladder,
and seat themselves at</i> <span class="smcap">Marie's</span> <i>feet.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> Was the old woman in the forest all dressed in gray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Yes, all in a long gray cloak, with a queer white
cap on her head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> Yes. Then I'm certain it was the Babushka. She is
sure to be wandering about on Christmas Eve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince.</span> Is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> That's what the story is about. Once upon a time,
hundreds and hundreds of years ago, there was a lonely little house
out in the fields where four great roads met.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha.</span> And by the house there was a big guidepost that
pointed four ways at once, to show people which road to take.
[<i>Stretches out both arms and swings his body slowly to show how the
post points.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> Babushka lived all alone in the little cottage. In
the summer the place didn't seem so lonely, for the banks at the
roadside were covered with bright flowers, and the days were long and
full of sunshine. But in the winter everything was white as far as
Babushka could see, and the wind howled, and the wolves howled, and
the birds were all gone. And Babushka was poor, and old, and lonely.
One winter day, when she was hurrying to get her work all done and
her house tidied before the dark came down, because she was too
poor to buy candles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">-219-</a></span> for herself, she heard a strange sound outside
like silver bells ringing above the whistling wind. She looked out
of her little window and saw a great train of people coming down
the broadest of the roads toward the crossroad. She never had seen
anything so strange before, for the leaders were not traveling in
sleighs or on horseback, but on three great splendid white camels.
The silver bells were hung about the camels' necks, and their saddles
were decorated with silver ornaments. And on the camels rode Three
Kings. Babushka knew they were kings because they were so richly
dressed and because each one wore a golden crown on his head. And
after them followed a long train of servants and guards. The Kings
did not know which road to take, and one of the servants was sent to
knock on Babushka's door and ask the way. At first the old woman was
so frightened that she wouldn't open the door, nor answer at all, and
the Kings themselves had to get down from their camels and come to
speak with her. The servants frightened Babushka, but the Kings were
so kind to her that she soon told them all she knew about the four
great roads. It wasn't very much, for she had never traveled further
than the nearest village, but she told the Kings that there they
could find shelter for themselves and their camels and their servants.</p>

<p>Then the first King said: "We have journeyed a very long way,
Babushka. We have been guided on the road by a glorious, shining
Star, and we know that by and by the Star will lead us to a little
new-born Baby."</p>

<p>The poor old Babushka wondered very much, and said: "Who is the
little child, my lord, that you should take such a long, hard journey
to find him?"</p>

<p>And the first King said: "He is a great King&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">-220-</a></span> King of all the
earth. When we find Him we will lay our crowns at His feet, with
these gifts we have brought&mdash;gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. We
are called Gaspar, Melchior, and Balthazar."</p>

<p>Babushka listened and looked. She saw the gold crowns, and she saw
that each one of the Kings bore in his hand a gift&mdash;one held a richly
embroidered bag which looked heavy, and it was, for it was filled
with gold. Another carried a beautiful crystal jar full of something
clear and golden. Babushka knew this must be myrrh, and suddenly she
knew, too, that the fragrance of spices filling the poor little house
must come from the incense in the stone vase she saw in the hands of
the third King.</p>

<p>She listened and looked, and then she said: "Kings have no need of
gifts, my lord. Why do you carry these gifts to the little child?"</p>

<p>And the first King said: "Because this King of all the Earth is the
King of Love, or He would not have come down into the world as a
little child. And because we love Him more than everything else, we
are bringing Him the very best that we have."</p>

<p>And the second King said: "Come, Babushka, go with us on our journey
to find the Christ-Child. He has come into the world to love and help
just such poor old creatures as you."</p>

<p>And the third King said: "There is room in His heart for you, and we
will gladly help you on the journey to Him."</p>

<p>And all the Kings begged her to go with them. But Babushka was afraid
and unwilling. She saw how cold and dreary it was outside, and she
knew that she was warm and dry in her little hut, even if she was
so poor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">-221-</a></span> She didn't know anything better than just to have enough
to eat, and a fire to keep her warm. She looked up into the dark,
threatening sky, and couldn't see any marvelous star through the
thick clouds. And, besides, she wanted to finish sweeping up her
house. She must surely do that first of all. But the Kings could not
wait, so they mounted their camels again, and soon Babushka heard
the music of the silver bells growing fainter and fainter in the
distance. All the next day, and the day after, and the day after
that, and every day all the year, and through all the years, Babushka
thought of her strange visitors. And still more she thought of the
little Child. And the more she thought, the more she grew to love
Him, until at last she began to wish she had gone with the Three
Kings. She grew more and more unhappy about it, until one day she
made up her mind that she would set out alone to try to find the
Child. She forgot how many, many years had gone by since the visit of
the Kings, and she didn't know that the Child had gone back to His
Throne in Heaven again. She locked her little cottage and set out,
going from village to village and from house to house, everywhere
seeking for the Christ-Child. When she found a little child who was
kind and loving and true, she said to herself: "This little one looks
as the Child I am seeking must have looked," and it made her very
happy. But still she didn't find the Child the Kings had found.</p>

<p>And, Princess, though it all happened such hundreds and hundreds of
years ago, the Babushka is still hurrying over the world in winter
time, looking in every nursery and every cottage for the little
Christ-Child. She comes in softly with just a rustle of her skirts,
and bends over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">-222-</a></span> the beds where little children lie asleep. She always
puts some small gift on the pillow, and steals silently out again. It
is only the children that are good and quiet who ever see her, and
she makes friends with them and gives them Christmas presents. But
she loves the babies best of all, I know, because she still hopes
to find among them the Baby who was laid in a manger on the first
Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matrena</span> [<i>after an instant's pause, pointing to window</i>].
Someone is at the window!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> I see her&mdash;it's the old woman who led us out of
the forest!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha.</span> It's the Babushka!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kolinka.</span> Perhaps she will come in. Let's be very quiet.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Children sing softly the carol of the Birds.<br />

<br />
[<i>Kneels by cradle, bending over the baby, and<br />

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess</span> [<i>suddenly springing up</i>]. Oh, Dimitri, why didn't
we beg the Babushka to take us home to the castle? Our Father and
Mother will be so terribly frightened when we don't come back!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince</span> [<i>hurrying to door</i>]. Perhaps it isn't too late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha</span> [<i>catching his arm, and standing before the door</i>].

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">-223-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kolinka.</span> And you mustn't go out in the cold again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess</span> [<i>in great distress</i>]. But we must let our father

<p><span class="smcap">Kolinka.</span> We will send a messenger as soon as we can, but

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha.</span> The wolves have been so bad that all the men have
gone out to hunt them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kolinka.</span> Perhaps someone will be back soon, and then we can
send. It isn't safe for the boys to go alone into the forest so late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha</span> [<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Prince</span>]. Father made me promise not to
go away until he came home. I'm not a bit afraid, though.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kolinka.</span> Sascha, run and ask old Semyon what he thinks.
[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Sascha</span>.] Sascha will bring Semyon back with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sascha.</span> Yes, and he says we must wait.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Princess</span>. Father! Father!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baron.</span> My children! Are you both safe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> Oh, yes, Father. These children have been so good
to us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baron.</span> Have they, my dear? Then they have been good to me,
too, and I thank them with all my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kolinka.</span> Oh, we haven't done anything, sir!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince.</span> Tell us how you found out where we were, Father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baron.</span> In rather a queer way, my son. We didn't miss you
just at once, but as soon as we knew you were gone everyone was in
a great fright, you may be sure. I started out with Sergius and
Smoloff, and half a dozen others to search for you in the forest. We
hadn't gone a hundred yards from the castle when we met the strangest
little old woman I ever saw, all dressed in gray, and wrinkled and
bent&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess</span> [<i>clapping her hands</i>]. The Babushka, Father, the
Babushka!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie</span>, <span class="smcap">Sascha</span>, <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Kolinka</span>. The Babushka
took the message!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince.</span> It was she who brought us here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Semyon.</span> Have you never heard of the Babushka, Baron?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baron.</span> Yes, yes! I know the old story of the Babushka, but I
never saw her before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">-226-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ivan.</span> She always comes to our village at Christmas time. We
don't all see her every year, but somebody always sees her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince.</span> What did she do, Father?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baron.</span> She did not speak at all. She looked at us for a
moment with the softest eyes imaginable, and then she stooped down
and pointed to your footprints in the snow. Then she pointed toward
the village, smiled, and beckoned to us to follow her. It seemed as
if she must have guessed our trouble, and she seemed so sure and so
full of cheer, that we couldn't help believing we should find you,
and followed her at once. I must reward her liberally for the great
service she has done me and mine this night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marie.</span> The Babushka wants no reward, Baron. You know what it
is she has been searching for all these years? Grandmother says it
was Love the Babushka wanted, and she has surely found it, for every
little child in Russia loves her dearly, dearly, and watches for her
at Christmas time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ivan.</span> And when she comes, the children sing their carols for
her. But the one she loves best is the "Golden Carol"&mdash;that's the
song of the Three Kings, you know, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Semyon</span> [<i>in doorway</i>]. The Babushka is coming now, with
her followers, my lord. Here they are! [<i>Enter a troop of village

smiles, each child exclaiming "Thank you!" "How nice!" etc., as he
receives his gift.</i>]</p>

glad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter.</span> Please, Babushka&mdash;I&mdash;I'm afraid I haven't been a very
good boy. But I'm sorry, and I'll try to do better next year. I'll be
bigger, then.</p>

children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Children.</span> Indeed we will, Babushka.</p>

home. Could you give me something for him?</p>

he'll be sorry enough he missed you, Babushka.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael.</span> So has mine, and he'll be sorry, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nadia.</span> Dear Babushka, I've kept the present so carefully

<h3>NOTES ON SETTING, MUSIC, AND COSTUME</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Russian Oven.</span> Made from a wooden packing-case, five or six
feet in height, covered with cambric, and painted to represent stone,
brick, or tiles. These stoves are decorated with rich panels in bold
conventional designs of flower or animal forms, or combinations of
geometrical figures. They are often so large that in the bitter
weather whole families may sleep on their tops, or on a platform
above.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ikons.</span> Pictures of the Christ, the Madonna, and the Saints,
much ornamented with gilt, and placed on a ledge in "the beautiful
corner," with candles in silver candlesticks, sweet-smelling grasses,
and flowers, real or of paper. Sometimes a carved wooden pigeon is
also placed before the ikons&mdash;the emblem of the Holy Spirit. The
wall in this corner is hung with long towels, either covered with
embroidery, or embroidered at the ends. Everyone who enters the room
makes an obeisance, and crosses himself, before the ikons. They are
specially decorated for Christmas.</p>

<p>Make the towels with stencils, as described in the notes on girls'
costumes.</p>

<p>The same characteristic designs are placed on ledges, cupboards, and
shelves, on the chest, or coffer, and ceiling beam, on carved wooden
boxes, dishes, and jugs, which are often displayed on a sideboard.
The knife and loaf placed on the coffer constitute a symbol of
hospitality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">-231-</a></span></p>

<p>The decoration of the stage need be limited only by time and
resources.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Music</span></h4>

<p>Search for information in regard to carol-singing in Russia having
been unsuccessful, old carols have been chosen which lend an
atmosphere of quaintness. The "Carol of the Birds" is old French,
the others English, "The Golden Carol" of the Magi being especially
appropriate to the story.</p>

<p>The sources for "Good King Wenceslas" are given on <a href="#Page_316">p. 316</a>. The
singing of this carol (also the "Golden Carol") is accompanied by the
Village Fiddlers on their violins. Semyon sings the part of the King,
Ivan that of the Page, all the children the narrative parts.</p>

<p>Others, with better knowledge of the subject, may be able to obtain
music more strictly suitable. The author would be glad to gain any
accurate information in regard to the use of Christmas carols in
Russia.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Costumes</span></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Boys</span> wear Russian blouses, and dark trousers, their legs
bound, from feet to knees, with yellowish rags; shoes suggesting
moccasins. Blouses may be made of canton flannel, white, or dull
colors, or of unbleached muslin, reaching halfway to knees. Neck
finished in a band; opening from collar down left side is not more
than six or eight inches, giving just room enough to put the head
through. Trim this collar and opening, also sleeves, with fur; or
put on a conventional border with stencil and paints, narrow at neck
opening, broad on sleeves. Tie in at waist with a short sash, ends
hanging, of bright color to match borders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">-232-</a></span></p>

<p>Outdoor winter costume of boys is a very thick, very full-skirted
coat of dark color, immense boots, cap of fur, or fur-bordered, and
bright scarf about neck, ends tucked into breast of coat. The village
children, however, may be supposed to rush in from their houses,
after the Babushka, without coats, but dressed as above, which is
both simpler and more picturesque.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girls&#8217;</span> costumes vary a little more.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Sleeveless dress, to ankles; white guimpe, long full
sleeves. Dress of bright colors, with band of plain color
edging bottom of skirt, neck, both of dress and guimpe,
and bordering white sleeves. Apron, white, with stenciled
designs in various colors.</p>

<p>2. Skirt to ankles, of soft faded blue or red, worn high on
the short white waist, which has full sleeves, gathered in
a band at the elbow. Trimmed with stenciled bands in bright
colors, at hem of skirt, on neck and sleeves, and also at
the edge of an immense handkerchief worn on the head and
knotted under the chin. This is large enough to spread out
over shoulders, and is straight across the back.</p>

<p>3. Plain narrow skirt of soft color, with a long-sleeved
apron (cream white), low-necked in front, and cut like an
Eton jacket in the back. This skirt has a band of plain
color at the hem, but the apron is trimmed with many rows
of stenciled patterns at the bottom, a narrow pattern
at neck and hand, and a broader one around the back at
the waist. White chemisette in front, also with band of
trimming.</p></div>

<p>Girls wear knots of ribbon hanging from the ends of their braids,
many strings of bright beads on the neck, and large gold hoops, or
enameled earrings in their ears.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">-233-</a></span> They may wear low shoes with bows
or buckles, or the soft, thick moccasin-like shoes worn by the boys.</p>

<p>Some few may be bareheaded. Others wear the large handkerchiefs
described above, and still others the picturesque "kokochnik," a
velvet, bead-trimmed crescent, worn forward on the head as in the
picture of "Marie." These are easily cut from cardboard, covered with
velvet, and trimmed in different patterns with small beads.</p>

<p>The stenciled patterns above-mentioned take the place of Russian
embroideries. They are repeated conventional designs, Greek patterns,
and fantastic forms of flowers, birds, and animals. Stenciling is
suggested as being the easiest and quickest way of getting the
desired effect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Babushka.</span> Long robe, and hooded cloak of light gray
canton flannel. The hood is worn over the head. She carries a quaint
basket filled with cheap little toys.</p>

<p>An adult is needed for this part, or an older girl of sufficient
insight and appreciation to carry out the simple pantomime and fill
it with the love and deep yearning of the Babushka, who is really a
spirit, and not a human being at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Baron.</span> Long military coat, below knees; cream-colored,
trimmed on breast with a pattern in gold braid, a band of same around
the edge and up the slits at the sides. Double collar, standing up
behind head and lying flat across back, scarlet with a gilt pattern.
Scarlet sash with sword or dagger. Red boots with blue heels. Spurs.
Sleeves open from shoulder to fur-trimmed cuff, and worn hanging.
Under-sleeve, and lining of coat-sleeve of a rich color. Hat with
flat-topped crown about eight inches high, scarlet, with gold
pattern; stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">-234-</a></span>ing brim, dark brown, three inches high, cleft in
front to show more of red and gold. Gilt cockade in front.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prince.</span> Russian blouse with military trimmings, scarlet and
white. Khaki trousers, boots, fur cap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Princess.</span> White cape and hood, trimmed with fur and silver.
Dress underneath not unlike the little peasants', but more richly
trimmed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old Semyon.</span> Long brown robe, halfway below knees, skirt
rather full. Legs bound in tan-colored rags. Moccasins. Coat has
broad collar with long reveres, and plain high vest inside, of same
material as coat. Hat made of the same, low, with rolling brim,
giving a turban-like effect. Long white hair and beard.</p>

<p>Marie, the eldest of the children, is perhaps fourteen; Kolinka,
twelve; Matrena, nine; Sascha, Ivan, and the Prince, eleven or
twelve; Pavlo and Nicolas, five or six; the Princess, nine. The
Village children should be rather small.</p>

<p>Satisfactory pictures of Russian homes and costumes are very
difficult to find, but there is a series of fairy-tales in Russian,
beautifully illustrated in color, which will be found most helpful to
those wishing to make costumes for this play. These books are to be
had at the Russian Importing Company, 452 Boylston Street, Boston,
and may also be seen in some of the larger Public Libraries.</p>

circus tent. [R.], another exit, leading out of doors. Music [if
possible] from circus tent, playing last strains of "Home, Sweet
Home." Burst of applause from circus tent, the flaps part, and the

<p><span class="smcap">Pepper</span> [<i>with his best professional manner</i>], Mr. Benjamin
Franklin Simpson and Mr. Daniel Webster Simpson, we have the great
honor to make you welcome to the most world-renowned, the most
marvelous single-ring circus upon the face of this Terrestrial
Globe&mdash;Pepper's Perennial Circus, so named because it never folds
its tents from season's end to season's end. I, Gentlemen, am Peter
Piper Pepper, the fortunate proprietor of this colossal assemblage
of artists. The members of my Company have desired the honor of
being presented to you personally before they exhibit to you their
unparalleled skill. It gratifies me exceedingly to comply with this
wish. [<i>Steps to side of platform and motions to troupe. As he calls
them by name they step forward and bow, with flourishes.</i>] Gentlemen,
allow me to present to you the distinguished, the glorious Signor
Frencelli, and Signor Cocodilla, who have charmed the crowned heads
of Europe. [<i>The clowns come forward and bow.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pepper.</span> Gentlemen, you see before you the world-renowned
Marco Brothers, known from the frozen North to the sunny South, for
their skill and ability in acrobatic feats. One of them also is a
famous bareback rider and performer of feats of equestrian valor. He
has a further talent of which you will be given an example a little
later.</p>

bathing-shoes, or "sneakers." Any colors may be used. Light blue for
Jack, and yellow for Hopkins are effective. Hopkins's ballet dress is
made of innumerable skirts of white tarletan, sewed to a low-necked
and short-sleeved waist of same material as his trunks, bespangled
with tinsel. This should be carefully put together and equipped with
buttons and button-holes, to slip on over the acrobat's clothes, so
that Hopkins's "lightning change" can really be made in the least
possible time. Woman's light yellow wig (or, if the boy is fair, a
dark wig), dressed in the extreme of style.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clowns.</span> Pierrot costumes. White with red spots, and yellow
with blue. Faces whitened with the usual red marks. Heads bald and
white. White soft Pierrot hats. They may provide themselves with
"slapsticks," and other properties incidental to their tricks and
jokes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minstrel.</span> Usual minstrel make-up. Black-face, large
collar, gaudy tie and vest. Flowered or large-checked trousers and
dress-coat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">-261-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dutch.</span> Khaki hat and trousers, shirt-sleeves, velvet vest,
stuffed to make him very rotund. Should be a short, roly-poly boy. He
carries by a strap over his shoulders a tray with bags of peanuts,
rolls of popcorn, etc. (Which will probably need to be kept under
lock and key until time for its use.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Animal-Trainer.</span> Dress suit and silk hat. Carries a
riding-whip.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tim.</span> Red flannel shirt, old trousers, very old felt hat,
boots. May double with</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farmer Simpson.</span> Old overcoat and straw hat. Red hair and
chin beard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dog</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Monkey</span>. It is best to rent these costumes
from a costumer, though, if preferred, close-fitting suits of brown
and black canton flannel, with long tails, may be made, and the heads
only, rented. Chain for monkey, leash for dog.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bub</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sonny</span>. Overalls, sneakers, and big straw
farm hats.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Setting</span></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Tent.</span> A most effective circus-tent can be made by fastening
strips of unbleached muslin above the stage-arch, and sloping them
down to a wire stretched five feet above floor at back of stage, then
dropping straight to floor. Back the entrances to the other tents
with more canvas, to represent a straight-sided passage.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Circus Performance</span></h4>

<p>A great deal of liberty may be allowed here. This play having been
written for a boys' club, the boys were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">-262-</a></span> intrusted with the duty of
working up the individual "acts," which they did very successfully,
with a little oversight and revision from those in charge.</p>

<p>The tricks by the Dog and Monkey were seesawing, boxing with gloves,
dancing, fighting a duel, etc., etc.</p>

<p>The Clowns introduced an "elephant walk," a race, juggling with
balls, and other tricks.</p>

<p>The Minstrel collected the latest and snappiest stories he could
find, and told them with zest.</p>

<p>The boys' own list of acrobatic feats, which will be understood by
boys doing work in a gymnasium, was as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Roll. Back and forth.</li>
<li>2. Roll and frog leap.</li>
<li>3. Short dive.</li>
<li>4. Long dive.</li>
<li>5. High dive.</li>
<li>6. High dive over man.</li>
<li>7. Weight-lifting.</li>
<li>8. Two-man dive.</li>
<li>9. Double roll.</li>
<li>10. Pyramid.</li>
</ul>


<p>They also included turning flip-flaps, walking on the hands, swinging
clubs, etc. The Pyramid, at the end, was formed by the whole troupe,
on hands and knees, the lightest boys on top, and at a given signal
all fell flat on the mattress.</p>

<p>The bareback riding of Hopkins and the dance of Zarah are fully
described in the text.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">-263-</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Music</span></h4>

<p>A good two-step, rapidly played, will serve for the galloping horse,
and Zarah can adapt herself to any modern dance-music.</p>

<p>For this play a carol or hymn is not appropriate, but rather a jolly
song embodying the idea of "Christmas comes but once a year."</p>

Orleans.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The curtain falls for a moment, during the
play, to indicate the passing of Christmas Eve and the
coming of Christmas Day.</p>
</div>

<p class="bp"><i>Curtain rises showing a comfortable room, strewn with a bachelor's
possessions. [R.] a fireplace<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> with wood fire, brass dogs, a large

toilet articles before the mirror,&mdash;military brushes, cologne, etc.,

easy-chair.</i> <span class="smcap">Laura</span> <i>leaning over the back.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Laura</span> [<i>affectionately stroking her brother's hair</i>]. Oh,
Henri, you can't guess how good it is to be at home again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">LeB.</span> Oh, yes, I can! What do you suppose it has meant to me
to have you and Louis and the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">-268-</a></span> wandering over the face of
the earth all these months? I've been a lost soul without you, and
your home to go to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laura.</span> Traveling's all very nice and interesting, but it
does pall! I grew tired to death of it&mdash;I just pined to come home
again, Henri. [<i>Sits on arm of chair.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">LeB.</span> And here you are at last, in time to save your poor old
brother from utter desolation at Christmas time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laura.</span> Oh, but I wish the house had been ready for us&mdash;it
hardly feels like Christmas anywhere but in the dear old place. But
Louis said it wouldn't do to hurry the workmen too much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">LeB.</span> No&mdash;they'd only make a botch of it. But you are
comfortable here, aren't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laura.</span> Yes, indeed&mdash;you've taken such nice rooms for us,
Henri. It's just the sentiment of it, you know, and I oughtn't have
spoken. And Madame Clementine does everything to make us feel at home
and comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">LeB.</span> How about the service&mdash;are the maids attentive, Laura?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laura.</span> Ask such a question about darkies just before
Christmas? Henri, you are a dear old silly! Of course they are. And
so many of them&mdash;I see a new one to provide with a "C'ris'mus gif'"
every day, I think. To-day I noticed another&mdash;not exactly a maid,
that is, but a funny little oddity of a pickaninny who seems to live
just to "fotch an' carry."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">LeB.</span> Yes, I've seen that little monkey&mdash;does she really
belong here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laura.</span> I'm not sure&mdash;I must ask Madame Clementine about
her.... Henri, if we are to make that call, I must get my things at
once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">LeB.</span> This is so cozy&mdash;do you think you <i>must</i> rout me out?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">-269-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laura.</span> Poor dear, his conscience has come home again!
[<i>Rises.</i>] Yes, I think we really ought. I've been at home three
days, you know, and the Percivals are such old friends, and Helen has
been ill&mdash;&mdash; [<i>Goes to door.</i>] I'll only be a moment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">LeB.</span> [<i>going to ring bell</i>]. Very well, Madame, I'm at your
service. If you are my conscience, sis, you certainly manage to
sweeten my duty.</p>

herself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">LeB.</span> Sh-sh! Don't waken her! [<i>They speak in lowered

experience of the old gentleman's impartiality seems to be
responsible for an experiment. Anyway, she popped up and assured me
that she was er white chile sho's I was bawn, and her name was Miss
Ann. But it stuck in her throat&mdash;&mdash;</p>

anything for her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laura.</span> Certainly I can, poor little soul. Such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">-275-</a></span> lot of

<h3>NOTES ON COSTUME AND PRESENTATION</h3>

<p>Ordinary modern costume. LeBreton should have an iron-gray beard.
Laura and her children daintily and attractively dressed.</p>

<p>Alphonse, mulatto servant, very dandified and vain.</p>

<p>Minty-Malviny, a black pickaninny, in rags and tatters, nondescript
and faded. Her wool braided into little pigtails tied with odd bits
of ribbon and string.</p>

<p>LeBreton, Laura, and Alphonse, by adults. Laura's children, five to
nine years. Minty-Malviny, ten years old. This part could be played
by a boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Music.</span> During the moment when the curtain is drawn for
the passing of the night, "Holy Night," or some other well-known
Christmas hymn, is very softly played off stage. LeBreton hums the
same air while filling the stocking, and moving about stage before
this interim.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span>: <i>Christmas Eve.</i></p>

<p class="bp"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <span class="smcap">Mrs. Darling's</span> <i>dressing-room.
Dressing-table, with elaborate and glittering toilette articles,
and a large and rather showy photograph of the late</i> <span class="smcap">Mr.
Darling</span>, <i>also a smaller one of</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Darling's</span>
<i>cousin, the</i> <span class="smcap">Reverend Dorel Goodhue</span>. <i>R., an alcove hidden
by curtains, containing a couch on which repose The Hundred dolls.
Stage requires two entrances, one communicating with</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Darling's</span> <i>bedroom, the other with the rest of the house.</i></p>


<p class="right">
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Catherine</span>, <i>with two carriage wraps,<br />
which she surveys critically.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catherine</span> [<i>sniffing at one of the wraps, with a sharp
glance at the bedroom door</i>]. Humph. If there's the merest smidgeon
of camphire about this, I'll hear from it! It's been airing 'most a
week, too. [<i>Lays them carefully on couch or chair, then stepping
softly, surveys the dressing-table and its appointments. Takes up
newspaper from chair, and glances over it while expressing her
sentiments.</i>] I'll just take this down with me till it's called for.
What with Mr. Jackson the butler, and Sally the kitchen-maid always
going home nights, and Cook slippin' off to her bloomin' family every
chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">-286-</a></span> she gets, it's likely to be lonesome for me this evening.
I'll be bound Mrs. Bonnet'll be off with some friend or other, the
minute Mrs. Darling's out of the house. Not that <i>her</i> company's
over-pleasant. I'd rather stay alone any time. It's good luck for
every other soul in the house when Mrs. Darling dines out. But <i>I</i>
never come in for the extras.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sally</span> <i>with fur-lined carriage shoes,<br />
which she places beside the wraps.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Mrs. Darling wanted those warmed in the kitchen. I
sh'd think all these fur fixin's 'd be warm enough without no stove.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catherine</span> [<i>sullenly</i>]. You going, too, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Why, yes. Ain't I done everything? There's no need of
me staying, is there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span> No, I don't suppose there is. I just thought you
might be, that's all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Tell you what I'd like to do!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span> What'd you like to do, Sally?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> [<i>confidentially</i>]. That's to come back again after
I've been home for just a minute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catherine</span> [<i>looks up, unable to conceal her interest</i>]. You
don't mean just to oblige, do you, Sally?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Well, I'd do it in a minute, for nothing else beside,
but that ain't quite all I was thinking of, just this once. Miss
Catherine&mdash;&mdash; [<i>hesitates, then continues enthusiastically</i>] &mdash;&mdash;have
you seen 'em in there? The whole hundred of 'em laid out in the
alcove here. [<i>Draws back curtain a little, partly disclosing the
couch with an array of daintily dressed dolls. They pick up one or
two, and look them over admiringly.</i>] I saw 'em last night when Mrs.
Bonnet she sent me up for the lamps to clean, and I've been thinkin'
about it ever since. Law!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">-287-</a></span> wouldn't any child like to see a sight
like that! There's a little girl in my tenement, she'd just go crazy.
Do you think there'd be any harm in it, if I was to bring her over
and let her get one peep? She's as clean a child as ever you saw. She
comes of dreadful poor folks, but just as respectable. She never seen
anything like it in her life. Law, what would I have done when I was
a young one, if I'd seen that? I'd thought I was dead and gone to
heaven. I say, Miss Catherine, do you think anybody'd mind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catherine</span> [<i>callously</i>]. How'll they know? Look here, Sally;
you go along as fast as you can, and fetch your young one. And when
you've got back, perhaps I'll step out a minute, two or three doors
up street, and you can answer the bell while I'm gone. Now hurry into
your things. I'll give you your car-fare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Miss Catherine, you're just as good as you can be,
and I'll do something to oblige you, too, sometime. [<i>Exeunt.</i>]</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Darling</span> <i>from bedroom in evening<br />
dress. Takes her cousin's photo from<br />
dressing-table and holds it at arm's length.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Darling.</span> Well, sir, does your charming cousin reach
your standard of feminine appearance? Or is she still far from that
pinnacle of elegance to which she aspires? She should be perfect
indeed when she is to pose before the world as the highly-favored of
the distinguished Mr. Goodhue.... And all the time, I know perfectly
well that he prefers Quaker gowns, or hospital caps and aprons....
Well, I'm not exactly a lily of the field, but when it comes to
Solomon in all his glory!... The morning papers will say so, at
least. "The Reverend Dorel Goodhue, accompanied by his cousin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">-288-</a></span> Mrs.
Darling," <i>and</i> so forth. Oh, sometimes I do grow so tired of it all!
It's such a farce!... Now, this won't do at all. The Reverend Dorel
Goodhue may preach to me on Sunday mornings, from a properly elevated
pulpit, in a proper and decorous and conventional manner, but&mdash;&mdash;
Just be kind enough to turn your reproachful face away, sir, and
let your cousin finish her prinking. [<i>Replaces photo face down.</i>]
Bonnet, why don't you come and do my hair?</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Bonnet</span>, <i>slowly waving a hot curling
iron.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bonnet.</span> Yes, Mrs. Darling.</p>

<p class="right">
[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Darling</span> <i>sits before mirror beautifying<br />
her finger-nails, while</i> <span class="smcap">Bonnet</span> <i>curls<br />
a few straggling locks of hair.</i><br />

<p class="right">
[<span class="smcap">Bonnet</span> <i>begins again, after a pause to make firm<br />
her nerve, catching the hair with infinite solicitude.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> [<i>almost screams</i>]. Mind what you're about! Didn't I
<i>tell</i> you to be careful? You've been pulling right along at the same
hair! <i>Do</i> consider that it is a human scalp, and not a <i>wig</i>&mdash;you
are dealing with! Bonny, you're not a bad woman, but you will wear me
out. Come, go on with it; it's getting late. [<i>She turns the photo
face out once more, and after a moment, as if the sight of it made
her repent, she rolls up her eyes angelically to the reflection of</i>
<span class="smcap">Bonnet's</span> <i>face in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">-289-</a></span> mirror.</i>] Bonny, do you think that
black moiré of mine would make over nicely for you? I am going to
give it to you. No, don't thank me&mdash;it makes me look old. Now, my fur
shoes.</p>

<p class="right">
[<span class="smcap">Bonnet</span> <i>brings the shoes and begins to struggle<br />
with them.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> [<i>bracing herself against</i> <span class="smcap">Bonnet's</span>
<i>efforts</i>]. I suppose&mdash;I suppose I have a very bad temper! [<i>Laughs
in a sensible, natural way.</i>] Tell the truth, Bonny; if every
mistress had to have a certificate from her maid, you would give me a
pretty bad one, wouldn't you? But I was abominably brought up. I used
to slap my governesses. And I've had all sorts of illnesses; trouble,
too. And I mostly don't mean anything by it. It's just nerves. Poor
Bonny! I do treat you shamefully, don't I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bonnet</span> [<i>expanding in the light of this uncommon
familiarity</i>]. Oh, ma'am, I would give you a character as would make
it no difficulty in you getting a first-class situation right away;
you may depend upon it, ma'am, I would. Don't this shoe seem a bit
tight, ma'am?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> Not at all. It's a whole size larger than the old
ones. If you would just be so good as to hold the shoe-horn properly.
There, that is it. [<i>Rises and stands surveying the two wraps.</i>]
Which shall I wear? [<span class="smcap">Bonnet</span> <i>draws back for a critical view,
but dares not suggest unprompted.</i>] The blue is prettier, but the
gray with ermine is more becoming. Oh, Bonny, decide for me quickly,
like a tossed-up penny!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bonnet.</span> Well, I think now I should say the blue one, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> [<i>musing</i>]. Should you? But I look less well in
it. Surely I would rather look pretty myself than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">-290-</a></span> have my dress
look pretty, wouldn't I? Give me the gray, and hurry. Mr. Goodhue
will be here in a second.... Bonnet, you trying creature! Didn't
I <i>tell</i> you to put a hook and eye in the neck of this? Didn't I
<i>tell</i> you? <i>Where</i> are your ears? <i>Where</i> are your senses? What on
<i>earth</i> do you spend your time thinking about, I should like to know,
anyway? I wouldn't wear that thing as it <i>is</i>, not for&mdash;not for&mdash;&mdash;
Oh, I'm tired of living surrounded by fools! Take it away&mdash;take it
away! Bring the other one.... Now, button my gloves. [<i>Looks at
herself in the glass, passively letting</i> <span class="smcap">Bonnet</span> <i>take one
of her arms to button the glove. Murmurs.</i>] Ouch! Go softly; you
pinch! [<span class="smcap">Bonnet</span> <i>changes her method, and pulls very gently.
Louder.</i>] Ouch! You pinch me! [<span class="smcap">Bonnet</span> <i>stops short, looks
helplessly at the glove, casts up her eyes as if appealing to heaven,
then tries again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> [<i>screams</i>]. Ouch, ouch, ouch! You pinch like
anything! I'm black and blue! [<i>Tears her arm from the quaking</i>
<span class="smcap">Bonnet</span>, <i>fidgets with the button, and pulls it off.</i>]
Bonnet, how many times must I tell you to sew the buttons fast on my
gloves before you give them to me to put on?... No, they were not!
[<i>Pulls off the glove and throws it far across the room. A knock at
the door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man's voice</span> [<i>respectfully</i>]. Mr. Goodhue is below, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> [<i>humbly, like a child reminded of its promise to
behave</i>]. Get another pair, and let me go. [<i>Tucks a final rose, or
bunch of violets into the bosom of her dress, turns to leave the

ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">-291-</a></span> see such a sight? One prettier than the other! I almost wish I
were one of the little girls, myself!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bonnet.</span> Them that gets them will be made happy, surely,
ma'am. I suppose it's for some Christmas Tree?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> They are for my cousin Dorel's Orphans. Pick up,
Bonny. Open the windows. Mind you tell Jackson to look at the
furnace. I shall not be very late&mdash;not later than twelve. [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Man's voice</span> [<i>only a shade less respectful than before</i>].
Miss Pittock is waiting below, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bonnet.</span> Very well, I'll be down directly. [<i>Exit, and
re-enter at once with a rather old-fashioned cloak and bonnet, which
she dons before the glass.</i>] I hope I haven't kept Miss Pittock
waiting. [<i>Looks contemptuously at her wrap.</i>] <i>She</i> looks quite
more than the lady in her mistress's last year's cape. They say the
shops is a sight to behold this year&mdash;I haven't a minute to get a
look at them myself&mdash;and it do seem as if people made more to-do
about Christmas than they used. I wonder what kind of shops Miss
Pittock'll fancy most. I'd rather see the show-windows in the Grand
Bazaar first. They do have the most amazing show there. Anyway, we've
got plenty of time. Her lady won't be home before twelve, and no more
will mine. [<i>Turns down gas, and exit.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Oh, Miss Catherine, I didn't know where you was. I
thought maybe you was gone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> [<i>hanging back</i>]. You didn't tell me! You didn't tell
me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span> Now you'll be sure she don't touch anything,
Sally. [<i>Looks</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>over.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Naw! She won't hurt anything. I've told her I'd skin
her if she did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span> Are her hands clean? You'd better give them a
wash, anyhow.</p>

<p class="right">
[<span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>drops her eyes, a little mortified.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> All right. I'll wash 'em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span> Did she scrape her boots thoroughly on the mat
before she came up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> I looked after all that, Miss Catherine. Just you go
along with an easy mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span> Well, I'm off. I won't be long gone. Why don't
you give her a piece of that cake? It's cut. But don't let her make
any crumbs. Here, give me your things. I'll take 'em down to the
kitchen. Good-by, little girl. I guess you never was in a house like
this before. Good-by, Sal. Is my hat on straight? [<i>Exit with coats.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> She's particular, ain't she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> I'd just as soon wash them again, but they're clean.
I thought you said she was gone off to a party, and going to be gone
till real late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> [<i>plumps down to contort herself in comfort</i>]. Law!
She thought it was Mis' Darling herself! Law!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">-293-</a></span> Law! [<span class="smcap">Tibbie</span>
<i>laughs, too, but less heartily.</i>] Now what'll we do first? Do you
want the treat right off?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> Oh, lemme guess, first, Sal, and tell me when I'm
hot! Is it made of sugar?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> No, it ain't.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> But you said it was a treat, didn't you, Sally?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> I did that. But ain't there treats and treats?
There's goin' to the circus, for instance. That hasn't any sugar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> Is it a circus, Sally? Is it a circus?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> No, it ain't a circus, but it's every bit as nice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> Is it freaks, Sally? Oh, tell me if it's freaks! It
isn't? Are you sure I'll like it very much? It's nothing to eat, and
it's nothing I can have to keep, and it's not a circus. What color is
it? You'll answer straight, won't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Oh, it's every color in the world, and striped, and
polka-dotted, and crinkled, and smooth. There's a hundred of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> [<i>rapturously</i>]. Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> [<i>takes her hand</i>]. Come along now, I'm going to
wash your hands in Mrs. Darling's basin. Ain't it handsome? [<i>Pokes
the scented soap under the nose of</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span>, <i>who sniffs
delightedly.</i>] Flowers on the chiny, too. [<i>Washes</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie's</span>
<i>hands while they talk.</i>] Did you get anything for Christmas yet,
Tibbie? [<span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>moves her head slowly up and down, absorbed
in the process of washing.</i>] What did you get?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> A doll's flatiron an' a muslin bag of candy. I put
the iron on to heat and it melted. I gave what was left to Jimmy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Who gave them to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> Off the Sunday-school tree. But there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">-294-</a></span> weren't no
lights on it because it was daytime. Sally, I know something that has
a hundred&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> What's that? Let's see if you've got it now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> [<i>shamefacedly</i>]. A dollar&mdash;is a hundred cents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Well, and would I be bringing you so far just to show
you a dollar? This is worth as much as a dollar, every individual one
of them. Tibbie, it's just the grandest sight you ever seen&mdash;pink and
blue and yellow and striped&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> [<i>after looking her fixedly in the face, now almost
shouts</i>]. It's marbles!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Aw, but you're downright stupid, Tibbie! I don't mind
telling you I'm disappointed. You're just a common, everyday sort
of a young one, with no idear of grandness in your idears, at all!
And you don't seem to keep a hold on more than one notion at a time.
First it's a dollar. Is that pink and blue? And next it's marbles.
Is marbles worth a dollar apiece? Now tell me what's the grandest,
prettiest thing ever you saw&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> ... Angels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> D'you ever see any?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> In the church-window, painted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Well, this is as handsome as a hundred angels, less
than a foot tall, all in new clothes, with little hats on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> Sally, I think I know, now. Only it couldn't be
that. There couldn't likely be a hundred of them altogether, for it
isn't a store you brought me to! You didn't tell me we were going to
a store.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> No more it is. We're going to stay right here in Mrs.
Darling's house, and no place but here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> [<i>faintly, looking all about</i>]. But where is there a
hundred of anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Oh, this ain't it, yet! This is only like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">-295-</a></span>
outside entry. Now, Miss Tibbs, what kind of scent will you have on
your hands?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> Oh, Sal!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> [<i>at dresser</i>]. Shall it be Violet, or Roossian
Empress, or&mdash;what's this other?&mdash;Lilass Blank? or the anatomizer
played over them like the garden hose? [<i>They unstop the bottles in
turn, and draw up great, noisy, luxurious breaths.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> This, Sally, this one with a double name, like
a person. [<span class="smcap">Sally</span> <i>pours a drop in each hand, and</i>
<span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>dances as she rubs them together.</i>] Why are the
little scissors crooked? [<i>Busily picks up things one after the
other</i>]. What for is the fluting-irons? What for is the butter in the
little chiny jar? What's the flour for in the silver box? Oh, what's
this? Oh, Sal, what's that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> It's to make you pale. It ain't fashionable to be
red. [<i>Picks up powder-puff, and gives</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span>, <i>who draws
back startled and coughing, a dusty dab on each cheek, then applies
it to her own. The two stand gazing in silent interest at themselves
in the mirror, gradually breaking into smiles.</i> <span class="smcap">Sally</span>
<i>suddenly hitches first one shoulder, then the other, and brushes her
face clean</i>, <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>faithfully aping her movements. Then
they look at themselves again.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> But I ain't pale, anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Law! that you ain't!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> Who's the gentleman, Sal, in the pretty frame?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> That's Mrs.'s husband. He ain't been living some time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> Oh, he ain't living.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Now, Tibbs, I'm going to get you that cake before I
show you the Hundred. You wait here. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">-296-</a></span> don't you hurt anything, or
I'll skin you sure, like I told Miss Catherine. And whatever you do,
don't you look behind that curtain till I come back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> Is the Hundred there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Yes, it's there. [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p class="right">
[<span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>looks at the curtain for a moment,<br />

<span class="smcap">Reverend Dorel</span>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> He looks like a real kind, good man. I'm going to
ask Sally if she knows him. [<i>Sits down on the floor and strokes
the fur rug. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sally</span> <i>with cake-box.</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span>
<i>chooses gravely, then speaks with her mouth full.</i>] I never tasted
any cake like this before. M-m-m-m! Say, Sally, this big thing's
'most as good as a dog. It's so soft I'd like to sleep on it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> [<i>with feigned coldness</i>]. Oh, all right! I don't
think we'll bother any more about seeing The Hundred.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> I had forgotten, honest, Sally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Eat your cake, and come along, then.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> [<i>jumping up</i>]. Can't I take it, in my hand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> No, for when you see 'em, you'll drop it quick all
over the floor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> [<i>hurrying it down</i>]. All right. I will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Wait a minute. You turn your back, and I'll go and
open the curtains. When I sing out, you turn around.</p>

<p class="right">
[<span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>stands facing audience, hands clasped<br />
tightly in impatience.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Ready!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">-297-</a></span></p>

<p class="right">
[<span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>gives one bound, then stops short<br />
quite overcome.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> [<i>expectantly</i>]. Well, ma'am? [<span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>stands
gazing, unable to speak.</i>] Well, I never! Don't you like 'em? What on
earth did you expect, child? Well, I never! Well, if it don't beat
all! Why, when I was a young one&mdash;&mdash; Why, Tibbie, girl&mdash;don't you
think they're <i>lovely</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> [<i>whispers</i>]. Yes. [<i>Nodding her head slowly, then
letting it hang.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> [<i>understanding</i>]. Aw, come out o' that! Come,
let's look at 'em one by one, taking all our time. Come to Sally,
darling, and don't feel bad. We'll have lots of fun. [<i>Takes</i>
<span class="smcap">Tibbie's</span> <i>hand and draws her nearer the dolls, then sits on
the floor and pulls</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>down into her lap.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> I had almost guessed it, you know, when you said
like angels with hats on. But I couldn't think there would be a
hundred unless it was a store. What has the lady so many for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Bless your heart! They ain't for herself! They're for
orphans in a school that a minister cousin of hers is superintendent
of. She's been over a month making these clothes. Every Wednesday
she would give a tea-party, and a lot of ladies come stitching and
snipping and buzzing over the dolls' clothes the blessed afternoon.
And I washed the tea things after them all!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> They are for the orphans. Are there a hundred
orphans?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Oh, I guess likely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> Suppose, Sally&mdash;suppose there were only ninety-nine,
and some girl got two!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Well, we two have got a hundred for to-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">-298-</a></span>night,
Tibbie, so let's play, and glad enough we've got our mothers. Look,
this is the way you must hold them to be sure and not crumple
anything. [<span class="smcap">Sally</span> <i>slips her hand under a doll's petticoats,
and they peep at the dainty underclothes.</i> <span class="smcap">Sally</span> <i>spurs
on</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie's</span> <i>enthusiasm by the tones of her voice,
making the wonder more, to fill the child's soul to intoxication.</i>
<span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>easily responds, fairly rocking herself to and fro
with delight.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> My soul and body! Did you ever see the like!
[<i>Sighs.</i>] And not a pin among 'em. All pearl buttons, and silk
tying-strings, and silver hooks and eyes; and, mercy on my soul! a
little bit of a pocket in every dress, with its little bit of a lace
pocket-handkerchief inside. D'you see that, Tibbie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> [<i>breathlessly</i>]. Oh, Sally! Oh, <i>Sal</i>ly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Come on, Tibbie; let's choose the one we would choose
to get if we was to get one given us. Now I would like that one in
red velvet. It's just so dressy, ain't it, with the gold braid sewed
down in a pattern round the bottom. Which would you take?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> I should like the one all in white. She must be a
bride; see, she has a wreath and veil and necklace. I should like her
the very best. But right after that, if I could have two, I should
like this other in the shade hat with the forget-me-nots wreath, and
forget-me-nots dotted all over her dress. And, see! the sky-blue
ribbon. If I could just have three, then I would take this one, too,
with the black lace shawl over her head, fastened with roses, instead
of a hat. She has such a lovely face! And after her I would choose
this one in green&mdash;or this one in pink; no, this one here, Sally;
just look&mdash;this one in green and pink. And you&mdash;if you could have
more than one, which would you choose, after the red one?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">-299-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Well, I guess I should choose this one in white.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> Oh, no, Sally, don't you remember? That is the
bride, the one I said the very first. You can have all the others,
Sally dear, except the bride. But let's see, perhaps there are two
brides. Yes!&mdash;no!&mdash;that is just a little girl in white, without a
wreath. Should you like her as well? I was the first to say the
bride, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Law! I wouldn't have wanted her if I'd known she was
a bride! I take this one, Tibbie&mdash;this one with feathers in her hat.
Ain't she the gay girl in red and green plaid? And this purple silk
one, and this red and white stripe, and this&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> Wait! That's enough; Sally, that makes four for you.
It's my turn now. If I could have five, I should take one of the
rosebud ones&mdash;no, two of them, so's to play I had twins. Say, Sally,
what if we could choose one apiece&mdash;first you one, and then me one,
till we'd chosen them all up, and got fifty apiece!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> What if we could! Wouldn't that be just grand! Tell
us some more you'd take.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> [<i>pointing and speaking at first slowly and
meditatively, then more and more quickly</i>]. I'd take this darling
blue girl, and this yellow one, and this cunning little spotted one,
and this, and this, and this, and this, and this&mdash;&mdash; Oh, Sally, if it
was only real, and not just let's-pretend! Now it's your turn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> [<i>placing her forefinger pensively against the side of
her nose</i>]. For my fifth one, I choose her&mdash;her with the little black
velvets run all through.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> [<i>promptly</i>]. Taken already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Then her over there with the short puffy sleeves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">-300-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> Taken!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> She taken, too? Well, then, her in the pink Mother
Hubbard, with the little knitting-bag on her arm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> Taken, Sally! Can't you remember anything? Those
belong to me; I chose them long ago. These are the not taken ones
over here; here, and here, and here, and here, and here, and here,
and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Aw, you're a great girl! [<i>Suddenly throws her arms
around</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>and casts herself back on the floor, where
they tumble and roll in a frenzy of fun.</i>] Oh, Tibbie, ain't we
having a time of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> [<i>almost shouting</i>]. Yes!&mdash;ain't we having a time of
it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Ain't this a night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> Oh, yes,&mdash;ain't it a night! [<i>They tickle and
poke each other until almost hysterical. At last</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span>
<i>disentangles herself from the panting and laughing</i> <span class="smcap">Sally</span>,
<i>and gets up.</i>] Here, Sally, now stop laughing, and let's go on. It
was your turn. You'd best take that one. She looks as if she might

cabbage! [<i>Laughs till she nearly cries.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Well, it's sure none of 'em has legs to make 'em look
like children of yours! [<i>At this</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>flings out her
thin black legs with the action of a young colt, and drops to the
floor, where they frolic as before. In the midst of their gale of
mirth, a bell rings. They sit up, and look at each other in silent
consternation.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> [<i>after a pause, in a solemn whisper</i>]. Murder!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> [<i>in her ear</i>]. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Was it the front door or the back door?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> I dunno, Sally. [<span class="smcap">Sally</span> <i>picks herself up,
and casts a hurried glance on the dolls and about the room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">-301-</a></span> to see

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> [<i>glancing at clock</i>]. It ain't late. It ain't a bit
later than I supposed. It can't be her! It might be Mrs. Bonnet,
though, getting home before Catherine, who's got the key. I shouldn't
want her to catch you here for the whole world. Look here, Tibbie.
You stand in here till I find out who it is, and if it's Mrs. Bonnet,
you'll have to stay hidden till I find a good chance to come and
smuggle you down. [<i>Pushes</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>through door, and exit
by other door.</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>very cautiously pokes her head out
and looks around.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> What's that scratching? I know there's a mouse here
somewhere. Go right away, mousie. There's nobody in here. Go right
away!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> [<i>without. Her voice calm, and pleasant with a kind of
company pleasantness</i>]. Tibbie! It's all right. It's just a friend
dropped in for a moment. You can play a little longer. Turn up the
light carefully. But remember what I told you.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>at the first sound of</i> <span class="smcap">Sally's</span><br />

Then moves the dolls about to<br />
bring those she has chosen closer together.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> [<i>meditatively</i>]. I can't play they are a family,
there are too many all the same age and all girls. I will play
they are a hundred girls in an orphan asylum&mdash;a very rich orphan
asylum&mdash;and that I am the superintendent. To-morrow I'm going to give
each a beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">-302-</a></span> doll for a Christmas present. This little girl's
name is Rosa. That one is Nellie. That one is Katie. That one is
Sue. And Mary. And Jennie. And Ethel, and Victoria, and Blossom, and
Violet, and Pansy, and Goldenlocks, and Cherrylips&mdash;&mdash; Oh, dear, I
know I can never name them all. There surely ain't enough names to
go around and I'd just have to make up names for them. Kirry, Mirry,
Dirry, Birry! These don't sound like anything. I wonder what they do
every day in orphan asylums. They must have school and learn lessons,
I guess. I'll be the teacher, now. Miss Snowdrop! [<span class="smcap">Tibbie</span>
<i>assists the dolls to move, and answers for them in a squeaking
little voice.</i>] "Yes, ma'am." Spell knot. "N-o-t." Not at all, my
dear. Sit down again, my dear. Miss Lily; stand up, miss, and see if
you can do any better this morning. Miss Pansy, I see you putting
your foot out to trip poor Miss Blossom. Don't you do that again,
child, or I shall have to stand you in the corner. Why, Rosy, how
red your cheeks are! Don't you feel well? "No, ma'am." Never mind,
don't cry. I must take you to the doctor's right away. Come, my
dear. [<i>Goes to dresser and looks in glass.</i>] Good-morning, doctor.
"Good-morning, ma'am" [<i>in a deep voice</i>]; "you've got a sick child
there, I see." Yes, doctor, this is a young lady from the orphan
asylum, and she says she's got a bad pain in her face. "Yes, yes. I
see, I see. Well, we'll give her something to cure those red cheeks
right up. Just come here, miss." [<span class="smcap">Tibbie</span>, <i>as the doctor,
powders the doll's cheeks very gently.</i>] Very well. Good-by, doctor.
"Good-by, ma'am. If she isn't better in fifteen minutes, let me
know." Now, my dear, you needn't go back to school. The orphans might
catch it. I'd like to rock you in my arms, but the superin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">-303-</a></span>tendent is
too busy.... Oh, dear, I don't like to be a superintendent. I think
I'll have you for my little girl [<i>draws forward a low rocker and
carefully turns down light</i>], and get you some nice little sisters
[<i>gathers a dozen dolls</i>], and then rock you all to sleep. [<i>Settles
comfortably in the chair.</i>] It's bedtime, and you must be rocked and
loved a little. Now, sh! Sh! Sh! Sh! What's that, Mamie? Sing to you?
Very well. [<i>Sings.</i>] Rosie, what are you crying for now? You want me
to rock faster? All right, I will. [<i>Rocks faster. Rosie continues to
cry, and the rocking soon becomes furious. In the excitement one doll
slips unnoticed to the floor.</i>] There, that's better. Now, children,
do go to sleep.... Mother is sleepy herself. [<i>Rocking becomes slower
and slower, and at last stops entirely.</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>falls
asleep.... Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sally</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Lively, Tibbie! Miss Catherine has got back. We must
be packing off home. I declare I lost sight of the time. There's just
no one like a fireman to be entertaining, I do declare. Mrs. Bonnet
won't be long coming now. [<i>Turns up light, sees</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span>
<i>rubbing her eyes, and the dolls all disarranged. Blankly.</i>] Law! do
you suppose we can get them to look as they did? I hope t' Heaven she
didn't know which went next to which. Do you remember, Tibbie, where
they all belonged?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> Yes, the bride went here. The rosebuds here. The
purple and gray here. I can put them all back, every one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> [<i>cheerfully, again</i>]. No one'll ever know in the
world they've been disturbed. [<i>Draws off to get general effect.
Dives for the last doll, which</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>sleepily hands up
from the floor.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> [<i>in a ghastly whisper</i>]. Tibbie! look at its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">-304-</a></span> head!
[<span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>gazes in a puzzled way. The face is crushed.</i>
<span class="smcap">Sally</span> <i>groans.</i>] Oh, Tibbie! now what'll we do!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> [<i>truthfully, lifting a very pale face</i>]. I didn't
do it! I was just as careful! She was one of my daughters. I had her
in my lap, rocking her to sleep with the others; she slipped off my
lap&mdash;there were too many for one lap, I guess&mdash;but I didn't step on
her. Sure, Sally,&mdash;sure as I live, I didn't step on her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Oh, law! You must have rocked on her. Oh, Tibbie,
what'll I do? Here, give her to me.... No, she can't never be fixed.
I wonder if I can cover her up, here. [<i>Moves the dolls about
tentatively.</i>] But what's the good? They'll count them, and there'll
be the mischief of a fuss. Oh, Tibbie&mdash;&mdash; [<i>reaching the end of her
good-nature</i>] &mdash;&mdash;why did I ever think of bringing you here? Now
look at all the trouble you've brought on me, when I thought you'd
be so careful! And I told you and told you till I was hoarse. And
here you've ruined all! [<i>Drops into a chair before the wreck.</i>
<span class="smcap">Tibbie</span>, <i>not daring to meet</i> <span class="smcap">Sally's</span> <i>eyes, stands
motionless and speechless.</i>] I declare I don't know <i>what</i> to do! I
wish I'd never seen 'em! I wish there'd never been any Christmas! Oh,
it's a great job, this! Tibbie, you've done for me this time!</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Catherine</span>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span> Hurry, and get off, now, Sally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> [<i>blurts out</i>]. She's broken one of them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span> You don't mean it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Yes, she has!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span> Let me see it. Oh, you wicked child! [<i>Shakes</i>
<span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>vigorously by one arm.</i> <span class="smcap">Sally</span>, <i>attempting
a rescue, seizes her by the other, and the poor child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">-305-</a></span> is jerked
about unmercifully.</i>] She's smashed its face right in! Now, whoever
heard of such naughtiness?</p>

<p class="right">
[<span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>escapes and twists about to get her<br />
back to the two.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> She didn't do it out of naughtiness, at all, Miss
Catherine. She's as good a child as ever lived! [<span class="smcap">Tibbie's</span>
<i>shoulders give a convulsive heave.</i>] It was an accident entirely.
But that's just as bad for me&mdash;I suppose I shall have to say it was
me did it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span> And then they'll say what was I doing while the
kitchen-help was poking about in the lady's chamber. No; you don't
get me into no trouble, Sally Bean! You'd much better say how it
was&mdash;how that you asked me if you just might bring a little girl to
look, and I said you might, out of pure good-nature, being Christmas
is rightly for children, and I've a softness for them. And while we
was both in the kitchen, she slipped away from us, and come here and
done it before we knew. And the child will say herself that it was
so. You'll be packed off, dead sure, out of this place, if you let
on you meddled with them yourself. She won't have her things meddled
with&mdash;&mdash; There! I hear the door now. There comes that old cat Bonnet.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bonnet</span>, <i>her cheek bones and<br />
the end of her nose brilliant with the cold.<br />
She carries a paper bag, and speaks with<br />
an impediment and a breath of peppermint.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bonnet.</span> What's the matter? What child is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span> It happened this way, Mrs. Bonnet. I allowed
Sally to fetch this child up to see Mrs. Darling's dolls.&mdash;Just for a
treat, of course&mdash;never thinking Sally'd be so careless as to let one
of them get broken. But that's what she done. I'd just stepped out
for a moment, never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">-306-</a></span> for a minute supposing anything like this could
happen, but you just see for yourself. That doll can't be mended no
way at all. And now, Mrs. Bonnet, what's to be done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bonnet.</span> Oh, you wicked little brat! I just want to get hold
of you and shake you! [<i>Makes a snatch at</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span>, <i>who gets
beyond her clutch, and turns scared eyes on</i> <span class="smcap">Sally</span>.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> [<i>just audibly</i>]. I want to go home; I want to go
home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bonnet</span> [<i>bitterly</i>]. It don't seem possible that I can run
out a minute just to do an errand for Mrs. Darling herself&mdash;to get a
spool of feather-stitching silk&mdash;but things like this has to happen.
Catherine, I thought you at least was a responsible person, and here
you has to go and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catherine</span> [<i>promptly</i>]. Mrs. Bonnet, you just let that
alone! Don't you try none of that with me! I went out of an errand
every bit as much as you did. I went out to make sure the ice cream
would be sent in good season for Christmas dinner, I did. Now I don't
get dragged into this mess one bit more than you do!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bonnet</span> [<i>looking at her with a poison-green eye</i>]. Well,
Mrs. Darling will be here in a minute, and then we shall see what
we shall see. Land, ain't that woman been cross to-day, and fussy!
'Tain't as if she was like other people&mdash;a little bit sensible, and
could take some little few things into consideration, and remember
we're all human flesh and blood. Not much! She don't consider
nothing, nor nobody, nor feelings, nor circumstances! She just makes
things fly! Things has to go her way, every time!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> [<i>pathetically, turning a trembling face to</i>
<span class="smcap">Sally</span>]. I want to go home!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">-307-</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bonnet</span> [<i>uglily</i>]. No, you shan't go home! You shall stay
right here and take the blame you deserve, after spoiling the face
of that handsome doll. What do you mean by it, you little brat, you
little gutter-imp!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> [<i>with a boldness new in her relations with</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs.
Bonnet</span>]. You let her alone, Mrs. Bonnet! Don't you talk to her
like that! Anyone can see she's as sorry as sorry can be for what
she's done, and all the trouble she's got us into&mdash;&mdash; [<span class="smcap">Cook</span>
<i>appears in door.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bonnet.</span> And what does that help, I'd like to know? The doll
is broke, ain't it? And some one of us is going to catch it, however
things go. You're a lucky girl, I say, if you don't lose your place.
Some one of us is a-going to, I can easy foretell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catherine</span> [<i>firmly, with lifted chin</i>]. I ain't going to
lose my place! Here comes Cook now! I suppose she wants to get into
trouble, too.</p>

<p class="right">
[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Cook</span>, <i>her high-colored shawl pinned<br />
on her breast with a big brooch, her<br />
bonnet-strings nearly lost in her fat chin.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cook.</span> What's the matter? What's it all about? Whose nice
little girl is this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> I brought her here, Mrs. McGrath. She's Tibbie, a
neighbor's child, and I brought her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cook.</span> To see them beautiful dolls. Of course. And one of
'em happened to get broke? [<i>Goes to</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span>, <i>and lifts
her miserable little face.</i>] Don't you feel bad one bit, darlin'! It
was all an accident, and it's no good crying over spilt milk. And if
Mrs. Darling gets mad at you, she ain't the real lady I take her for.
Why, I gave my Clary a new doll this very evenin' and it's ready for
a new head this minute. And did I go for to rare and tear about it?
Not a bit of it! Why, bless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">-308-</a></span> you, she didn't go for to do it! Why,
what child smashes a doll a-purpose? You're a pretty set, the whole
gang of you, to pitch into a child! [<i>Tries, with</i> <span class="smcap">Sally</span>,
<i>to comfort and silence</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span>, <i>who by this time is freely
weeping. Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Bonnet</span>, <i>and re-enter at once without hat and
coat.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cook</span> [<i>looking hard at</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Bonnet</span>]. I've a great
mind to stay here myself and stand up for her, yer pack of old maids,
the lot of yer!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bonnet.</span> You will oblige me, Mrs. McGrath, by doing nothing
of the sort. We've no need to have a whole scene from the drama.
You've no business on this floor, anyhow, and I must insist on your
keeping yourself in your own quarters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cook</span> [<i>mutters</i>]. And I'll take my own time, yer born
Britisher! [<i>Putting her arm around</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span>.] Well, Tibbie
dear, you can be sure of this: however bad this seems, it'll soon be
over. And if Mrs. Darling scolds, that'll soon be over, too. It'll
all be looking different to you in the morning. However things goes,
you'll soon be forgetting all about it. And to-morrow is Christmas
Day, that our own dear Lord was born on, and I'll bake you a little
cake and send it to you by Sally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> [<i>sobbing</i>]. But Sally's going to be sent away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cook.</span> So she might be, but I feel it in my little toe that
she ain't going to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sally</span> [<i>bravely</i>]. Well, if I am, I am, and there an end.
But I don't see why she can't take the price of the doll out of my
wages and let me stay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bonnet.</span> I think you'll find that it ain't most particularly
the cost of the doll gets you into trouble&mdash;&mdash; There she comes this
minute!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> You, too. Pleasant dreams. Good-night. [<i>Sound of

[<i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Darling</span>. <i>Stands a moment at<br />

of absent-minded astonishment.</i><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> What is it? Has anything happened? What is everybody
doing up here? Whose little girl is this sitting up so late? They
used to tell me I should never grow, my dear, if I sat up late&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bonnet.</span> This is what it is, ma'am. I took the liberty of
stepping out for a few moments, it being Christmas Eve and my work
all done, knowing you wouldn't be needing me till late. And Sally
here took it upon herself to bring a child&mdash;how she could presume so,
I'm sure <i>I</i> don't understand, ma'am. She might have known aforehand
something would be broken. And sure enough&mdash;when I come in&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> Oh, cut it short! What you have to tell is that the
child there has broken one of the dolls, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bonnet</span> [<i>mutters</i>]. That's it, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. D.</span> And you've kept her here when she ought to have been
in bed these hours, to bear the first burst of my displeasure&mdash;&mdash;
[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Darling</span> <i>says so much in a hard voice, with an
appearance of cold anger; here her voice suddenly dies, and she
bursts out crying like a vexed, injured child.</i>] I declare it's too
bad! [<i>She sobs, reckless of making a spectacle of herself, while
all look on in consternation.</i>] I declare it's too bad! It's no use!
It doesn't matter <i>what</i> I do&mdash;it's always the same! It's <i>always</i>
taken for granted that I will conduct myself like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">-310-</a></span> a beast. Who can
wonder, after that, if I do? Here I find them, pale as sheets, the
five of them shaking in their boots, because a forlorn little child
has broken a miserable doll. And <i>what</i> is it supposed I shall do
about it? Didn't I dress the hundred of them for children, and little
poor children, too? And I must have known they would get broken, of
course. <i>Why</i> did I dress them? <i>What</i> did I spend months dressing
them for? Solely for <i>show</i>, they think,&mdash;not for any charity, any
kindness, any love of children, or anything in the <i>world</i> but to
make an effect on an occasion&mdash;to make myself a merit with the
parson, perhaps! [<i>Her crying seems to become less of anger and
nervousness, and more of sorrow.</i>] Oh, it is too bad! One would
imagine I never said a decent thing or did a kind act to anyone.
And, Heaven knows it's not for lack of trying to change. But no one
sees the difference! I am treated like a vixen and a terror. And the
people about me hate and fear and deceive me! A proof of it to-night.
Oh, the <i>lesson</i>! Oh, I wasn't <i>meant</i> for this! I wasn't meant for
it! When I think of last Sunday's sermon and how straight to my heart
it went. Oh, I am a fool to cry! [<i>Dries her eyes, and holds out her
hand to</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span>.] Come here to me, dear child. What is your
name? What? A little louder! What did you say? Tibbie! Oh, what a
nice, funny name! <i>You</i> didn't think I was going to scold you, did
you, dear? Of <i>course</i> not! It was an accident; I understand all
about it. I used to break my dolls' heads frequently, I remember very
well. [<i>Puts her arm about</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span> <i>and tries to make her
head easy on her shoulder.</i> <span class="smcap">Tibbie</span>, <i>however, cannot relax,
and rests uncomfortably against her.</i>] Let us see, dear, now, what we
can do to make us both feel happier. I dressed all those dolls for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">-311-</a></span>
little children I am not acquainted with at all. Which of them would
you like the very best? Which should you like for your very own?</p>

of course, you would want that poor dolly to nurse back to health.
Now, dear, isn't there <i>one more</i> you would like? [<span class="smcap">Tibbie's</span>

call her Cynthia, after me. How would you like that? Suppose we say
this one with the forget-me-nots? She looks a little like me, doesn't
she, with her hair parted in the middle? Her dress is made of a piece
of one of my own, and that blue is my favorite color. [<i>Rising.</i>]

<p><span class="smcap">Sally.</span> Pretty and wholesome-looking. Appears at first in a
limp blue kitchen-apron, later in her outdoor coat and hat, neat, but
cheap-looking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibbie.</span> Old dress, very neat and clean, but faded, and with
an outgrown, hand-me-down appearance. She is a thin and half-fed
little tenement-house child, to whom the luxury of Mrs. Darling's
house is an undreamed-of fairy-land.</p>

<p>This part was played by a little girl of nine, who delighted in
learning and acting it. A bright and appreciative child can do it
without undue effort, although it is, of course, the important rôle
of the play.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Dolls.</span> The number of dolls need not be over fifteen or
twenty, if so arranged as to suggest more tiers hidden from view at
the back of the couch. They should be as nearly of one size as is
practicable, though uniformity goes no further. The broken one should
be broken first, and Tibbie must slip it to the floor unnoticed
before she sits down to rock the others.</p>

<h2><a name="GENERAL_NOTES" id="GENERAL_NOTES">GENERAL NOTES</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Fireplace.</span> If scenery is not available, the fireplace used
in this play, and in several others, can easily be built up from
packing-boxes covered with cambric (dull side out), the bricks
or tiles marked in black paint, or even with ink. A valuable and
effective stage-property, used when "Tom's Plan" was first given,
and in many subsequent plays, was an old-fashioned wooden mantel,
obtained through a carpenter who was tearing down an old house. This
may be a suggestion for other amateurs. A small screen can be covered
with cambric, and painted to represent the back of the fireplace, an
opening being left at one side, through which Santa Claus, in "Tom's
Plan," "The Christmas Brownie," and "Their Christmas Party," makes
his entrance. Andirons, with logs and a red electric bulb, will make
a very pretty and effective fire. In "Their Christmas Party," the
poor children hide in the fireplace, and the "Christmas Brownie" goes
in and out several times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Red or brown coat, trimmed with ermine (cotton,
or, if practicable, some real fur); high boots; cap to match coat,
with fur brim. He wears a string of sleigh bells over his shoulder,
and carries a pack full of small toys for distribution. White hair,
mustache, and long white beard.</p>

<p>In these plays, in which Santa Claus has often an important part,
do not on any account allow him to wear a mask. The hair, mustache,
and beard, with a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">-314-</a></span> rosy make-up, are sufficient disguise for
him, and in those cases where there are little children in the cast
whose literal belief in Santa Claus must not be disturbed, he is
not indispensable at rehearsals. Partly because he should not be
recognized, an adult player is always indicated for this part, rather
than an older boy, who is apt to be in more intimate touch with the
children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Christmas Tree.</span> If the play is to serve as introduction
to a Christmas Tree, the tree should be placed as near the stage
as possible. When the play is over, the lighted tree is unveiled,
and the children who have taken part distribute the presents under
the leadership of Santa Claus. Or, if found more practicable, the
tree may be placed in another room, and Santa Claus may invite the
children of the play and the audience to go with him in search of it.
An appropriate tree song may be sung by the whole audience. Reference
to such songs may be found on the following page.</p>

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
